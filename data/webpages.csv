Watch: Matt Hancock told the Covid inquiry that ""Cummings caused toxic culture"" Entering lockdown three weeks earlier would have cut deaths in the first Covid wave by 90%, former health secretary Matt Hancock has said. Mr Hancock told the Covid inquiry that with the benefit of hindsight the UK should have locked down much sooner. He also said a ""toxic culture"" existed in government driven by Dominic Cummings, the PM's chief advisor. But he denied accusations he lied to colleagues during the pandemic. Mr Cummings - who left No 10 in December 2020 after falling out with then PM Boris Johnson - hasbeen particularly scathing of Mr Hancock. Offered a chance to respond, Mr Hancock called Mr Cummings a ""malign actor"" who subjected Health Department staff to abuse as they grappled with the emergence of Covid. He argued it was having to do the work of other departments, for example on school closures, and that its ""hard work"" was hindered by ""a toxic culture that we had to work with"". He said Mr Cummings sought to grab power from Mr Johnson while shutting out ministers from key meetings. There was an ""unhelpful"" assumption that ""when anything was difficult or a challenge... there was somehow fault and blame"", Mr Hancock said. The Mid-Suffolk MP was health secretary from 2018 until June 2021, when he was forced to resignafter breaching Covid guidance. He was suspended as a Conservative MP, after appearing on ITV's I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here in 2022 and later said he would not stand for re-election as an MP. More on Covid and the Covid Inquiry During his testimony Mr Hancock said ""many, many lives"" could have been saved if the UK government had initiated the first coronavirus lockdown around 2 March 2020, rather than 23 March. However, he stressed that there was still ""enormous uncertainty"" and only 12 cases had been identified in the country by this point. He told the inquiry he was speaking with ""hindsight"" and robustly defended his role in the pandemic and that of the department he led. ""From the middle of January, we were trying to effectively raise the alarm,"" he said, adding: ""We were trying to wake up Whitehall to the scale of the problem."" Not 'adequate' Pushed on when he advised Mr Johnson that immediate action would be needed to contain the virus, Mr Hancock said he raised the alarm bell on 13 March. However, the inquiry's lawyer, Sir Hugo Keith KC, questioned the statement, noting that this was not mentioned in the entry for 13 March in Mr Hancock's book, Pandemic Diaries. Mr Hancock replied that the evidence only came to light after his diary was published and cited an email he sent the prime minister calling for a ""suppression strategy"". Sir Hugo argued that this did not amount to calling for an immediate lockdown. Asked about the existence of pre-prepared plans for a pandemic, Mr Hancock said they existed butrepeated his previous assertionthat they were not ""adequate"". Mr Hancock will continue his evidence on Friday. His former boss Mr Johnson will give evidence to the inquiry on 6 and 7 December. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is also expected to give evidence before the end of the year. The inquiry has been bruising for the politician, with past witnesses accusing Mr Hancock of ""nuclear levels"" of overconfidence and a lack of honesty. Helen MacNamara, a senior civil servant during the pandemic, said he would say things that would turn out not to be the case. Sir Patrick Vallance, the former chief scientific adviser,saidMr Hancock had ""a habit of saying things which he didn't have a basis for"". Mr Hancock said there was no ""evidence whatsoever"" that he lied during the pandemic. In the session, the inquiry was shown extracts from Sir Patrick's diary which described a ""massive internal mess"" inside the health department and reported that then-civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill complained of the department's ""clear lack of grip"". Government response Mr Hancock has been criticised for saying in the early days of the pandemic that a ""protective ring"" had been thrown around care homes. He said he used that phrase to refer to actions including giving the sector Â£3bn and providing protective equipment. However, he appeared to agree with suggestions that the protections did not amount to ""an unbroken circle"". He also told the inquiry that he did not know about the ""Eat Out to Help Out scheme"" - whereby the government subsidised people to go to restaurants in the summer of 2020 -  until the day it was announced. He acknowledged he had concerns about how it impacted infection rates, however he said he did not express those publicly because he abided by ""collective responsibility"". 'Greatest regret' Mr Hancock was also questioned about apparently contradictory evidence on when the government knew people without symptoms could transmit the virus. Referring to a report by the US's Centre for Disease Control, he said there was not clear evidence until the beginning of April and up to then he had been advised not to base policy on the assumption that transmission could be asymptomatic. Mr Hancock said it was his ""single greatest regret with hindsight"" that he didn't overrule the advice. ""I was in the pro-let's worry about asymptomatic transmission camp. The frustration was that, understandably from their point of view, and here I'm putting myself in their shoes, the Public Health England scientists said we have not got concrete evidence."" The inquiry was shown messages between Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick in which they suggest the government had known about asymptomatic transmission. Posting on Xas the inquiry was going on, Mr Cummings said Mr Hancock was ""talking rubbish"".

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-67143989,"What is COP28 in Dubai and why is it important? World leaders are meeting to discuss tackling climate change at a big UN summit in Dubai. It follows a year of extreme weather events in which many climate records have been broken. What is COP28 and where is it? COP28 is the 28th annual United Nations (UN) climate meeting where governments will discuss how to limit and prepare for future climate change. The summit is being held in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), from 30 November until 12 December 2023. What does COP stand for? COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", where the ""parties"" are the countries that signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992. Why is holding COP28 in Dubai controversial? The UAE is one of the world'stop 10 oil-producing nations. It has appointed the chief executive of the state-owned oil company, Sultan al-Jaber,president of the COP28 talks. Oil - like gas and coal - is a fossil fuel. These are themain causes of climate changebecause they release planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burned for energy. Mr Jaber'soil company plans to expand production capacity. Documents leaked to the BBC suggest theUAE planned to use its role as host to strike oil and gas deals. Mr Jaber has previously argued that he isuniquely well-placed to push for actionfrom the oil and gas industry, and that as chairman of renewable energy firm Masdar,he has also overseen the expansion of clean technologieslike wind and solar power. Why is COP28 important? It is hoped COP28 will help keep alive the goal of limiting long-term global temperature rises to 1.5C. This was agreed by nearly 200 countries inParis in 2015. The 1.5C target is crucial to avoid the most damaging impacts of climate change, according to the UN's climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Long-term warming currently stands at about 1.1C or 1.2C compared with pre-industrial times - the period before humans started burning fossil fuels at scale. However, recent estimates suggest theworld is currently on track for about 2.4Cto2.7C of warming by 2100, although the exact numbers are uncertain. As a result, thewindow for keeping the 1.5C limit in reachis ""rapidly narrowing"", the UN says. What will be discussed at COP28? As well as progress towards the existing Paris goals,COP28 will concentrate on: There will also bethemed days on issues including health, finance, food and nature. Who is coming to COP28? Around 200 governments have been invited. US President Joe Biden and China's Xi Jinping are not expected to attend, but both countries will be represented. UK Prime MinisterRishi Sunak will take part, andBuckingham Palace has confirmedthat King Charles will also attend. He will deliver an opening address to delegates on 1 December. Pope Francis hascancelled his planned visit due to illness. Environmental charities, community groups, think tanks, businesses and faith groups will also take part. Hundreds of delegates with links to fossil fuelsattended COP27 in 2022. Will there be an agreement on fossil fuels? There is likely to be disagreement about the future of ""unabated"" fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas which are burned withouttechnologies to capture their emissions. Mr Jaber has called for a ""phase down"" in their use, meaning a reduction over time, but not a complete end. However, the EU and other groups are expected to push for a full ""phase out"". Climate campaigners point out that restricting agreements to ""unabated"" fossil fuels would allow some production to continue. They say there is no guarantee capturing emissions will work at scale. There are alreadyfar more fossil fuels currently being produced or under constructionthan could be burned if the world is to limit warming to 1.5C, according to a recent report by the UN Environment Programme. Will richer countries pay for climate change? As COP28 got under way, it was announced that the""loss and damage"" fundcan starthanding out money. The fund wasagreed at COP27. The idea is that richer countries will pay poorer countries already facing the effects of climate change - because richer countries have contributed most to global warming. But the details of how it will work have remained deeply contested, with richer countries like theUS reluctant to accept liabilityfor past emissions. While arelatively small amount of moneywas pledged on the opening day of COP28, getting the fund up and going is seen as a crucial step in building trust between richer and poorer countries. Separately, in 2009, developed countries pledged to give $100bn (Â£82bn) a year to developing countries by 2020, to help them reduce emissions and prepare for climate change. The target was missed in 2020, but is""likely"" to be met by 2022, according to preliminary data. It is hoped thatCOP28 will help to establish the next stepsfor advancing the $100bn pledge. Will COP28 make any difference? Critics of previous COPs, includingcampaigner Greta Thunberg, accuse the summits of ""greenwashing"" - where countries and businesses promote their climate credentials without making the changes needed. But as world leaders gather, the summits offer the potential for global agreements that go beyond national measures. For example, the 1.5C warming limit, agreed in Paris at COP21, has driven ""near-universal climate action"", according to the UN. This has helped bring down the level of warming the world can expect - even though the world isstill not acting at anywhere near the pace neededto achieve the Paris goals.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-67563543,"Why is North Korea saying it's watching the White House? North Korea has declared it's got the White House in its sights thanks to its new spy satellite - which the regime says is up and running, although the West has its doubts. Still, leader Kim Jong Un has been crowing over his new surveillance toy; and he's been happily sharing the alleged results. Reports put out by state media on Tuesday trumpeted a list of targets the North says it's seen: the White House, the Pentagon and air force bases along the US north-east coast and in its Pacific territory of Guam. Closer to home, Pyongyang also listed South Korean military targets and its port city of Busan. Further afield and slightly more baffling: Rome. But while the scope might at first seem impressive, there may be less to it than meets the eye. ""I will say that there are plenty of images of the Pentagon and the White House online,"" said a US military official on Tuesday in response to the picture reports. ""So, let's leave it at that."" Anyone can clap eyes on the White House these days using Google Earth and internet livestreams. The BBC tried it - a live cam of the White House was the first result on YouTube. So what is Mr Kim playing at here? Why has he made a big deal of this and does he actually get anything useful? Does the North have a working satellite? To begin with, there's still significant doubt over whether the North's satellite is working at all. It's been floating up there for over a week nowand there's been no independent confirmation that it's beaming images back to Mr Kim. The US, South Korea and Japan say only that they know it is in orbit. And if we know one thing about the North, it's that it is a country that ""lies all the time"", says Fyodor Tertitskiy, who researches North Korean politics at Kookmin University in Seoul. ""If they say something, that is not necessarily true. Always look at the action,"" says Mr Tertitskiy. Pyongyang has a history of peddling doctored images- making claims about military prowess and weapons far exceeding its actual capability- for propaganda aimed at domestic and international audiences. The North this time has also chosen to not release the pictures it's supposedly receiving. It might be withholding the pictorial evidence so its enemies won't know the scope of what it's seeing exactly. But it has in the past released pictures it's proud of.In 2022, it put out photos of Earth as seen from space,which the North said were taken on their most powerful missile launch in years. Strategic value But if it is the case that the satellite is functioning, experts believe the surveillance content delivered would be of a pretty poor quality. The North Korean satellite has a limited resolution range of of 3m-5m per pixel, analysts say. ""So even if it can see the White House, it has no tactical usage,"" says Uk Yang, a North Korea military researcher at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. Despite the low resolution, though, North Korea's satellite now means it can identify and select targets for nuclear strikes. ""So the satellite has its strategic meaning,"" says Mr Yang. And while it might currently be inadequate for gathering more meaningful intelligence, this move might also be about the North pushing its tech edge. ""The goal is to advance capabilities while normalising its launches... that violate UN Security Council resolutions,"" says Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul. The regime has long defended its satellite programme. It argues that having it is a sovereign right, a military necessity and a domestic political promise, says Prof Easley. Dave Schmerler, a satellite imagery expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), also says he thinks ""it's a big leap for them going from zero to something"". ""But until we can see the images they're collecting, we're speculating on its use cases,"" hetold Reuters news agency. Symbolic value For Pyongyang, having eyes in the sky has also been a long-term goal politically - especially when the West has been able to surveil its territory for decades already. ""Pyongyang resents and fears what American satellites can see and believes it's in a space and arms race with Seoul,"" says Prof Easley. That the reports surfaced in North Korea's main newspaper, Rodong Sinmum, suggests they were aimed at both domestic and foreign audiences, says Mr Tertitskiy. For Western audiences, the North is presenting a ""conspicuous show of force"" regardless of whether it is real or not, he says, and a deliberate message of deterrence, warning the West against striking the North's military and nuclear bases. ""The message is if you ever dare strike our military targets, we will kill you. ""And one of the reasons why they're so obsessed with the White House - the idea is to send that message personally to Joe Biden: We see you. And not just you America, but you Mr Biden.  We see you and we can kill you."" For those living in the isolated Communist dictatorship, the claims of technical advancement are also designed to show the country is performing well. The launch announcement last week and the picture reports on Tuesday bookended ""elections"" held for local assemblies across the country. ""I suspect the claim that the new satellite can see important sites in the US such as the White House and the Pentagon may be aimed at a domestic audience rather than an international one,"" said Dr Sarah Son, a lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Sheffield in the UK. ""[This is] based on the fact that ordinary North Korean civilians have no access to the internet and likely have no awareness of the extensive resources available in the rest of the world for looking at satellite imagery of other places.""

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55992592,"Can I get a Cold Weather Payment and how much are they? A cold snap will lead people to use more energy and feel the pressure from higher bills, but there is some financial help when there is a run of sub-zero temperatures. Many people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland received Cold Weather Payments last winter when there was a period of extremely cold weather. The system is different in Scotland, where those on low incomes and benefits may receive theWinter Heating Payment. However, this does not depend on how low the temperature gets. Anonline postcode checkerallows people in England and Wales to check who is eligible forCold Weather Payments. People in Northern Ireland cancheck if they are eligible here. How much are Cold Weather Payments and who are they for? Cold Weather Payments are a government benefit top-up to help with fuel bills during times of exceptionally cold weather. These payments are not age-related. To qualify, you must already be eligible for one of five benefits and fulfil additional criteriaoutlined on the government website. The benefits could be: Each Cold Weather Payment is paid for a seven-day period and is worth Â£25. There can, and has been, more than one payment made during the course of the winter for each extended cold period. The scheme covers the period between 1 November and 31 March each year. Hospital stays can affect payments, while benefit offices also want to know if you have had a baby or if a child under five lives with you. How are the payments triggered? The average temperature must be zero degrees Celsius - or less - for seven days in a row, or forecast to be below freezing for seven consecutive days. This temperature needs to be recorded by the weather station nearest to your postcode. You can check whether you are eligible byentering the first part of your postcode here.

Watch: A minute of money-saving tips with the BBC's Matt Taylor and Colletta Smith How does this differ from the Winter Fuel Payment? The Winter Fuel Paymentis a different benefit, paid out to pensioners. More than 11 million pensioners receive that benefit, which is between Â£100 and Â£300, regardless of weather conditions. It is calculated according to age and whether you live alone. This year it is boosted by an extra Â£300 cost-of-living payment. Another, unconnected, benefit is theWarm Home Discount, which is a Â£150 rebate for some pensioners and people on low incomes. How do I get them and how long does it take? You do not have to do anything in order to get Cold Weather Payments. Payments arrive automatically and are paid straight into your bank account within two weeks. Each period of very cold weather in your area should trigger a payment. It is paid into the same bank or building society account as your benefit payments. Cold Weather Payments do not affect your other benefits. If you do not receive your Cold Weather Payment, tell the pension centre or Jobcentre Plus office.

Eurostar said the train was now on its way back to London. The firm said an overhead cable fell on the 08:16 GMT train, travelling from London to Amsterdam, at the entrance of the Channel Tunnel. A spokesperson said about ""700 passengers and crew on board are confirmed to be safe."" Jessica Chambers, from Essex, was supposed to be travelling to Amsterdam for her friend's birthday. Speaking to the BBC while she was stuck on board, she said: ""It truly feels like an emergency situation but thereâs no communication from staff."" Eurostar said on X that it was not possible to make customer announcements ""due to a lack of power on board"". At about 15:15 GMT, Ms Chambers said the train was getting dark as the lights were out due to the lack of power. ""Following a complicated situation due to the position of the train and the track infrastructure, itâs meant that certain safety procedures had to be adhered to before we could move the train,"" said Eurostar. Customers said they could not flush the toilets and sent photos showing that they were completely blocked. Rebecca Morris, from Horsham, West Sussex, said her group of six had been given water but no food. She said the situation on board was ""just dreadful"" and passengers were ""freezing cold"". Ms Morris and her colleagues were planning to travel to Brussels to see the Christmas markets. The Eurostar spokesperson said all affected passengers would be met in London with refreshments and would receive enhanced compensation. ""Eurostar are sorry for issues caused that customers have experienced today,"" they added. BBC reporter Hannah Roe, who is in Brussels, said there was also disruption there. ""Passengers have reported delays of hours, with many only just boarding trains theyâve been waiting for since the morning,"" she said. She said many passengers had tickets cancelled and rebooked onto different seats to make room for those supposed to be on earlier, cancelled, trains. Eurostar have been contacted for comment.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67565898,"Omid Scobie book: How could the royal naming mistake happen? So how does the Dutch version of a book have lines that don't appear in the original English edition? Not any random lines - but a highly damaging reference linking members of the Royal Family to a race row that has rumbled on for years. That's the royal puzzle after theDutch translation of Omid Scobie's Endgame appeared to reveal the nameof people alleged to have made comments about the skin colour of the baby that Prince Harry and Meghan were expecting. It's started a wave of speculation, from front pages to social media - including Piers Morgan announcing the alleged names on his TalkTV programme. And on ITV's This Morning programme on Thursday, Scobie once again said he had ""never submitted a book that had their names in it"". The naming in the Dutch language version of Endgame has been presented as a mistake, a very embarrassing one, and the book has been hastily taken off the shelves. But how could it have happened? The Dutch language edition, Eindstrijd, has a very plain identification of a senior royal and another less specific reference to a second name. The publisher's managing director, Anke Roelen, said on Tuesday night: ""An error occurred in the Dutch translation and is currently being rectified."" As a result, the publishing house, Xander Uitgevers, is ""temporarily withdrawing the book"", with its release day descending into chaos. It's now going to be re-released on Friday, in a ""rectified"" version, say the publishers. Although the blame was initially placed on the translation process, a comparison of the English and Dutch text doesn't suggest it's about getting some of the phrases or vocabulary mixed up. The line clearly identifying a member of the Royal Family isn't in the English text, so it hasn't been mistranslated. It seems to have been added. And an updated message from the publisher now talks of an ""error"", without mentioning translations, if that has any significance. The next thought might be that this was part of a draft or a previous edit that had been taken out of other language versions, but had mistakenly not been updated in the Dutch version. But the author Omid Scobie, speaking on Dutch television on Tuesday, made it clear that any version he had produced had never named names. So that would rule out this having been a draft or remnant of some previous editing that had not been removed. ""There's never been a version that I've produced that has names in it,"" the author told the RTL Boulevard show. ""The book's available in a number of languages and unfortunately I can't speak Dutch, so I haven't seen the copy for myself, so if there have been any translation errors I'm sure the publisher's got it under control,"" said Mr Scobie. In pre-publicity, he had made a specific point of saying that for legal reasons, he wouldn't identify the names involved in the race row that emerged from Prince Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey. Prince Harry and Meghan themselves have never given the name of the person or persons, who were alleged to have asked questions about the skin colour of their as yet unborn baby. As Meghan herself has observed about the potential consequences of revealing the name: ""I think that would be very damaging to them."" After this was first revealed in the Oprah Winfrey interview in 2021 it sparked a royal race row, and questions about the identity of those involved have become a lingering cloud. This latest book makes the claim that there were two people involved in asking these questions rather than one. Apart from an update on Wednesday announcing a new release date, the publisher has still to say what went wrong - but that won't stop those trying to work out what happened. Could it have been some kind of publishing version of a hack or a hoax? Was it a sales stunt? A prank? Stray text put in for a joke and then not removed? Or someone changing text after the proofreading was finished? What's surprising is that any other news lines in the book were heavily trailed, including excerpts in the US press and in interviews. So it might seem odd to bury the biggest bombshell in the middle of the book, without any subsequent explanation of this revelation, and without any kind of highlighting of the claim. After this short line revealing the name, the Dutch text goes back to the same as the English, while you might expect it to reference back or expand on such a major revelation, which would be the biggest moment in the book. If a publisher had decided to take such a big decision to reveal this information, it would be its biggest selling point as well as its biggest risk. Either way, if it was going to be deliberately revealed it's hard to see why it would be tucked away as a single line, mid-text, rather than milked in every way to boost sales. Buckingham Palace hasn't been commenting on what has appeared in the Dutch edition of Endgame, in a book that already had been taking aim at the senior members of the Royal Family. The English-language publishers, Harper Collins, have also not responded. In the wake of the Oprah interview, with its toxic questions about racism and the royals, the late Queen's response had included: ""Recollections may vary."" In this latest Dutch whodunnit, it seems translations may vary too.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67578991,"Alistair Darling: Steady hand in an economic crisis As a radical student, Alistair Darling hoped to reshape the world. As chancellor, he found himself at the centre of global crisis steering the UK's troubled banks back from the brink during the 2008 financial crash. He served at the heart of New Labour, with 13 years in Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's cabinets. He once said he hoped to be remembered as ""the minister who began to eradicate poverty"", but he will go down in history for the actions he took as chancellor in 2008. His were the steady pair of hands who shepherded the British economy through the near collapse of half its banking system. He was best known for having to nationalise Northern Rock at first, and then effectively the bulk of British banking amid runs on banks by the public and financial markets.

Alistair Darling tells of Gordon Brown's time as prime minister in his new book He began his memoir of his period at Number 11 with the phrase ""I don't believe in panicking until it's absolutely necessary"". It was a doctrine that was sorely tested as faced financial chaos unseen in Britain for decades. Born in London, Alistair Darling attended the fee-paying Loretto School near Edinburgh. His friends said Mr Darling did not enjoy life at the severe private school, and his experiences influenced his shift to left-wing politics. His old history teacher was shocked to see a grown-up Mr Darling speaking aggressively in interviews as Chancellor. This was a ""very quiet"" boy who ""played his cards close to his chest"" at school, Peter Lappingtold the BBC back in 2008. Radical student He did his legal training in the city before representing it in local government and ultimately in Parliament. While Mr Darling had the air of a mild-mannered, non-confrontational Scottish lawyer, his political origins were actually somewhat more lively. As a student activist in Aberdeen, he was associated with far-left policies and reportedly distributed ""Marxist"" leaflets at railway stations. But after being elected as an MP in 1987, he left left-wing roots behind and his image was transformed from firebrand to moderate. Mr Darling became closely linked with efforts to modernise Labour. In opposition, he served on the front bench in several roles, including as home affairs spokesman. Ahead of the 1997 election, he also toured the boardrooms of the big City firms, to reassure them of New Labour's intentions. Following the party's landslide election win, Mr Darling served as chief secretary to the Treasury, putting in place wide-ranging reforms to financial regulation. He then replaced Harriet Harman as social security secretary  - later re-named work and pensions secretary -  delivering Labour's welfare reforms and taking responsibility for spending a third of the government's budget. Mr Darling said he would like to be remembered as ""the minister who began to eradicate poverty"", but he was targeted by pensioners outraged when their pensions were raised by only 75p. The episode led to a rebellion at Labour's conference in 2000, opposition coming from Labour giant Barbara Castle. Mr Darling, said to have a knack for mastering complex briefs in record time, was parachuted into another ""trouble"" job in 2002, when Stephen Byers resigned as transport secretary amid the collapse of Railtrack.

EU referendum: Alistair Darling denies 'Project Fear' To gauge how he was doing in top jobs, Mr Darling said he would apply the ""Tesco test"" - watching how people would react to him when he was out shopping. ""If they look away, you are in trouble,"" he wrote in his memoir. ""If they engage with you, either through eye contact or, even better, conversation, then you are in with a chance."" Throughout cabinet career, Mr Darling achieved the seemingly impossible of being close to Gordon Brown and not estranged form Tony Blair. When his long-time political ally, Mr Brown, moved to 10 Downing Street in June 2007, Mr Darling, the quiet man of the cabinet, replaced him as chancellor. Many thought he would be a ""yes"" man, cowering in the shadow of his powerful boss. But he staked out his independence when, in the summer of 2008 - and not long before the collapse of Lehman Brothers - he warned of the worst financial crisis in 60 years. One of his biggest clues a looming financial crisis came in the shape of a ""gift-wrapped panettone"" hand delivered by Sir Fred Goodwin, chief executive of RBS, appeared at his doorstep over Christmas 2007. ""He would not admit it, but I sensed that RBS, which until that time had seemed invincible, its directors and senior staff exuding confidence verging on arrogance, was in more trouble than we had thought,"" Lord Darling wrote. Election defeat The financial crash resulted in a backlash from those close to Gordon Brown, with Mr Darling later remarking that the ""forces of hell"" had been unleashed on him. He eventually fell out with his neighbour and boss over the need for spending cuts after the significant increase in government borrowing during the financial crisis. That disagreement, Lord Darling believes, was what led to Labour's 2010 general election defeat. During the brief interregnum after the 2010 election, on a journey to Brussels, he privately acknowledged the game was up, and expressed little surprise at the Liberal Democrats handling David Cameron a stable five year majority. After Labour lost power, Alistair Darling returned to the backbenches. But he took a central role in the Better Together campaign, which campaigned for a ""No"" vote in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. He made a significant contribution although he reluctantly took on the role, and felt bruised by the schisms in Scottish society during a brutal campaign. But he joined back up with Gordon Brown, and ultimately played a vital role in keeping the union together. He was created Lord Darling of Roulanish, in 2015 but retired from the House of Lords in 2020. He was married to Margaret, and had two children, Calum and Anna.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-67557533,"Climate summit in an oil state: can COP28 change anything? You are going to be hearing a lot about COP28 over the next two weeks. The world's most important climate meeting, beginning on Thursday, is being hosted in Dubai by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - one of the world's top ten oil producers. COP28 will be the biggest gathering of world leaders of the year. King Charles III and Rishi Sunak will be there, along with dozens of other world leaders and some 70,000 other attendees. Hosting a climate conference in a petrostate was already controversial - but theBBC's evidence that the UAE  team planned to use climate talks ahead of COP28 to do oil and gas dealshas heightened concerns. So, can a summit in one of the world's richest oil states deliver meaningful action on climate change? Campaigner Greta Thunberg has said theseUN climate summits are just ""blah, blah, blah""- meaning all talk and no action. But if the COP process did not exist, we would certainly want something like it. Imagine for a moment that you are an alien visiting the Earth. You discover the planet faces a potential catastrophe caused by the actions of the people living there. The first thing that alien would say is: ""You guys all need to get together and agree how to sort this out"". But making progress is tough going. You may be surprised to discover that the first time that the world collectively agreed to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change was only eight years ago, atCOP21 in Paris. Nearly 200 countries pledged to keep global temperature rises ""well below"" 2C and ""pursue efforts"" to limit them to 1.5C - crucial to avoiding the most dangerous climate impacts, according to UN scientists. That Paris agreement in 2015 was a big step forward and has triggered ""near-universal climate action"", the UN says. This has helped bring down the level of warming the world can expect. Butthe world is still not acting at anywhere near the pace needed to achieve the Paris goals, a recent UN report confirmed. Trying to address this will be one of the biggest issues for the conference. More on the COP28 climate summit At the top of the agenda is an attempt to get an agreement to make the promises of action governments give - known in UN jargon as ""Nationally Determined Contributions"" or NDCs - more comprehensive. The idea is that commitments should get progressively bolder over time - like a ratchet, irreversibly increasing ambition. The hope for COP28 is an agreement that NDCs should be broadened to cover the emissions from all economic activity - including food and farming, for example. There will also be an effort - and this is a longshot - to try and make countries a bit more accountable for the promises they make. Currently, the Paris deal can't force countries to do anything - in the UN process, all action is voluntary. Another key issue will be cash. There will be a lot of talk about who pays who for what. The good news is renewable technologies like wind and solar have got far cheaper andthe electricity they generate is now less expensive than fossil fuelsin many cases. One of the UAE's targets is to get the world to sign up to treble the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030 -already agreed by the US, China and other G20 countries. It also wants an agreement to double the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. These measures require large upfront investment, even if they could bring savings in the long term. And preparing for - and dealing with - the impacts of climate change we already know are coming is going to cost trillions of dollars. At the heart of these discussions is the profound inequality that divides the world. Most rich countries got rich by burning fossil fuels. Poorer countries say the richer nations now need to use some of that cash to help them go green and to deal with the climate impacts the rich world created. A long-standing promise by developed countries to find $100bn a year to help developing nations with climate action - initially promised by 2020 - looks like it has finally been met. Also look out for evidence that big global institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are bowing to pressure to change their lending rules to help get the cash flowing. But it will not all be plain sailing. The big success ofCOP27 in Egypt in 2022was the agreement to create anew ""Loss and Damage"" fundto help deal with climate disasters in the poorest countries. But which countries - if any - will put money in the fund? The European Union has indicated it is going to open its wallet, but what about the US and other big economies? China, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States are still defined as developing countries for COP purposes, by the way, and therefore aren't obliged to pay into funds like this - a big bone of contention. And finally we can expect the return of an old COP favourite - the game of ""down or out"". This is the question of the language used to describe the world's long-term ambitions for ""unabated"" fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas which are burned without technologies to capture their emissions. In other words, should the world look to gradually reduce the production and use of polluting fossil fuels over time (""phase down""), or put a complete end date to it (""phase out"") - and when should this be? It's a particularly fitting question this year, with the conference being held in a petrostateplanning to increase its oil production capacity. The COP28 president, Sultan al-Jaber, wants to see a ""phase down"", but many countries, including those in the EU, are expected to push for a full ""phase out"". Astonishing as it may seem, the world still hasn't officially committed to either yet. That's despite warnings that there are already far more fossil fuels currently being produced or under constructionthan could be burned if the world is to limit warming to 1.5C. So, let the discussions begin! Additional reporting by Mark Poynting. What questions do you have about COP28?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67576784,"Covid inquiry: Lockdown should have been three weeks earlier - Hancock This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Watch: Matt Hancock told the Covid inquiry that ""Cummings caused toxic culture"" Entering lockdown three weeks earlier would have cut deaths in the first Covid wave by 90%, former health secretary Matt Hancock has said. Mr Hancock told the Covid inquiry that with the benefit of hindsight the UK should have locked down much sooner. He also said a ""toxic culture"" existed in government driven by Dominic Cummings, the PM's chief advisor. But he denied accusations he lied to colleagues during the pandemic. Mr Cummings - who left No 10 in December 2020 after falling out with then PM Boris Johnson - hasbeen particularly scathing of Mr Hancock. Offered a chance to respond, Mr Hancock called Mr Cummings a ""malign actor"" who subjected Health Department staff to abuse as they grappled with the emergence of Covid. He argued it was having to do the work of other departments, for example on school closures, and that its ""hard work"" was hindered by ""a toxic culture that we had to work with"". He said Mr Cummings sought to grab power from Mr Johnson while shutting out ministers from key meetings. There was an ""unhelpful"" assumption that ""when anything was difficult or a challenge... there was somehow fault and blame"", Mr Hancock said. The Mid-Suffolk MP was health secretary from 2018 until June 2021, when he was forced to resignafter breaching Covid guidance. He was suspended as a Conservative MP, after appearing on ITV's I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here in 2022 and later said he would not stand for re-election. More on Covid and the Covid Inquiry During his testimony Mr Hancock said ""many, many lives"" could have been saved if the UK government had initiated the first coronavirus lockdown around 2 March 2020, rather than 23 March. However, he stressed that there was still ""enormous uncertainty"" and only 12 cases had been identified in the country by this point. He told the inquiry he was speaking with ""hindsight"" and robustly defended his role in the pandemic and that of the department he led. ""From the middle of January, we were trying to effectively raise the alarm,"" he said, adding: ""We were trying to wake up Whitehall to the scale of the problem."" Not 'adequate' Pushed on when he advised Mr Johnson that immediate action would be needed to contain the virus, Mr Hancock said he raised the alarm bell on 13 March. However, the inquiry's lawyer, Sir Hugo Keith KC, questioned the statement, noting that this was not mentioned in the entry for 13 March in Mr Hancock's book, Pandemic Diaries. Mr Hancock replied that the evidence only came to light after his diary was published and cited an email he sent the prime minister calling for a ""suppression strategy"". Sir Hugo argued that this did not amount to calling for an immediate lockdown. Asked about the existence of pre-prepared plans for a pandemic, Mr Hancock said they existed butrepeated his previous assertionthat they were not ""adequate"". Mr Hancock will continue his evidence on Friday. Mr Johnson will give evidence to the inquiry on 6 and 7 December. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is also expected to give evidence before the end of the year. The inquiry has been bruising for the politician, with past witnesses accusing Mr Hancock of ""nuclear levels"" of overconfidence and a lack of honesty. Helen MacNamara, a senior civil servant during the pandemic, said he would say things that would turn out not to be the case. Sir Patrick Vallance, the former chief scientific adviser,saidMr Hancock had ""a habit of saying things which he didn't have a basis for"". Mr Hancock said there was no ""evidence whatsoever"" that he lied during the pandemic. In the session, the inquiry was shown extracts from Sir Patrick's diary which described a ""massive internal mess"" inside the health department and reported that then-civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill complained of the department's ""clear lack of grip"". Government response Mr Hancock has been criticised for saying in the early days of the pandemic that a ""protective ring"" had been thrown around care homes. He said he used that phrase to refer to actions including giving the sector Â£3bn and providing protective equipment. However, he appeared to agree with suggestions that the protections did not amount to ""an unbroken circle"". He also told the inquiry that he did not know about the ""Eat Out to Help Out scheme"" - whereby the government subsidised people to go to restaurants in the summer of 2020 -  until the day it was announced. He acknowledged he had concerns about how it impacted infection rates, however he said he did not express those publicly because he abided by ""collective responsibility"". 'Greatest regret' Mr Hancock was also questioned about apparently contradictory evidence on when the government knew people without symptoms could transmit the virus. Referring to a report by the US's Centre for Disease Control, he said there was not clear evidence until the beginning of April and up to then he had been advised not to base policy on the assumption that transmission could be asymptomatic. Mr Hancock said it was his ""single greatest regret with hindsight"" that he didn't overrule the advice. ""I was in the pro-let's worry about asymptomatic transmission camp. The frustration was that, understandably from their point of view, and here I'm putting myself in their shoes, the Public Health England scientists said we have not got concrete evidence."" The inquiry was shown messages between Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick in which they suggest the government had known about asymptomatic transmission. Posting on Xas the inquiry was going on, Mr Cummings said Mr Hancock was ""talking rubbish"".

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67578993,"Former Chancellor Alistair Darling dies aged 70 Alistair Darling, the Labour chancellor who steered the UK through the 2008 financial crisis, has died aged 70, a family spokesperson has said. Following Labour's landslide 1997 election win, Lord Darling served in cabinet for 13 years under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He was best known as the steady pair of hands who shepherded the UK economy as half its banking system collapsed. The ex-Edinburgh MP died after a short spell in hospital, his family said. A statement issued on behalf of his family called Lord Darling a ""much-loved husband of Margaret and beloved father of Calum and Anna"". The family said he died in ""Western General Hospital under the wonderful care of the cancer team"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Lord Darling ""lived a life devoted to public service"". ""I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have benefited from Alistair's counsel and friendship,"" added Sir Keir. ""He was always at hand to provide advice built on his decades of experience - always with his trademark wry, good humour."" The whole Labour movement felt a ""profound"" wave of shock, he added. Mr Brown, who after becoming prime minister brought Lord Darling in as chancellor, said he was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of his death. He told the BBC: ""In times of crisis Alistair was the person you would want in the room because he was calm and he was considered and he had great integrity."" This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Alistair Darling ""showed great wisdom in everything he did"" says Gordon Brown Tony Blair added his voice to the tributes, calling Lord Darling ""a rarity in politics"". ""I never met anyone who didn't like him. He was highly capable though modest, understated but never to be underestimated, always kind and dignified even under the intense pressure politics can generate."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Lord Darling's passing ""is a huge loss to us all"", while Chancellor Jeremy Hunt described him as ""one of the great chancellors"", who did ""the right thing for the country at a time of extraordinary turmoil"". Eradicate poverty Alistair Darling was born in London in 1953 and but moved to Scotland to attend the prestigious Loretto school in Musselburgh. Despite becoming known as the mild-mannered New Labour centrist, Mr Darling was associated with far-left policies as a student activist in Aberdeen - reportedly distributing ""Marxist"" leaflets at railway stations. A lawyer by profession, he first entered politics in 1982 after being elected to the former Lothian Regional Council. Five years later he became an MP, and was seen as a key ally of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as they sought to modernise their party and transform it into New Labour. Entering government 10 years later Mr Darling served as chief secretary to the Treasury, putting in place wide-ranging reforms to financial regulation, after the collapses of Barings and BCCI. He then replaced Harriet Harman as social security secretary - a role now known as work and pensions secretary -  delivering Labour's welfare reforms and taking responsibility for spending a third of the government's budget. While in this role Mr Darling once said he hoped to be remembered as ""the minister who began to eradicate poverty"". Despite a long career in government little could have prepared Lord Darling for his near three-year stint as chancellor - the job for which he was handpicked by Mr Brown in June 2007. 'Scariest moment' He was appointed amid seemingly calm economic times. But it was a Number 11 tenure marked by financial chaos, unseen in Britain for decades. His decision to nationalise Northern Rock at first, and then effectively the bulk of British banking amid runs on banks by the public and financial markets set the tone for the global response to the 2008 financial crash. Looking back on the financial crisis, Lord Darlingsaid the ""scariest"" momentwas when the Royal Bank of Scotland called to tell him they would run out of money that afternoon. In his memoirs he wrote: ""My initial reaction must have been a bit like that of the captain of the Titanic when he was told by the ship's architect that it would sink in a couple of hours. There were not enough lifeboats for all the passengers."" Mr Darling, predicted by many commentators to be a Brown ""yes man"" he fell out with his neighbour and boss over the need for spending cuts after the significant increase in government borrowing during the financial crisis. In his memoirs, published after Labour was voted out of office, Mr Darling said there was a ""permanent air of chaos and crisis"" when Mr Brown was prime minister. 'Flying colours' Despite leaving government, Lord Darling did not leave frontline politics for long. He led the successful Better Together Campaign in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Former first minister of Scotland Alex Salmond, who led the opposing Yes Scotland campaign said he never had a ""cross word"" with Mr Darling outside the ""intense"" televised debates. Mr Salmond said: ""When the moment of test came, Alistair passed with flying colours."" Former Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said Lord Darling ""was not the flashiest of politicians but he gave one hundred per cent to any job he did and always left things better than he found them"". Lord Darling was a vocal advocate for remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum - launching the Stronger In campaign with Conservative chancellor George Osborne. When he left the House of Commons in 2015 he was made a peer, but eventually retired from the House of Lords in 2020.

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-67579695,"Pressure grows for ban on new leasehold flats The government is facing growing calls to ban new leasehold flats in England and Wales. It has said a ban on the sale of new leasehold houses will be added to a bill, which has been introduced to Parliament, as soon as possible. But Minister Baroness Penn said abolishing leasehold for flats was ""more complicated"" and reforms would be taken forward at a later date. Campaigners, Labour and some Tories want leasehold to be scrapped entirely. Under the current system leaseholders often have to pay ground rent and expensive maintenance charges. This is because they only own the lease, which gives them the right to use the property for a fixed term, but not the land it is built on. A bill, which was introduced in Parliament on Monday, would make it easier and cheaper for homeowners to extend their lease or buy their freehold. At the moment this can be a complicated and expensive process, often costing thousands of pounds including legal fees. However, the bill did not include a ban on new leasehold flats. Campaign groups want a commonhold system - where occupants jointly own and take responsibility for their buildings without an expiring lease - to replace leasehold for new flats. Raising the issue in the House of Lords, Labour's shadow spokeswoman for housing Baroness Taylor said: ""Of course we welcome the reform of leasehold but with five million leasehold properties in England, 70% of which are flats, there is disappointment that they are not included in the bill."" Baroness Penn, a junior minister in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, told peers reforming leasehold for flats was ""inherently more complicated"" than for houses as they required an arrangement to facilitate management of the building. ""For flats, the government remains committed to reinvigorating commonhold to give developers and homeowners a viable alternative to leasehold should they choose it,"" she said. She added: ""We will be taking forward at a later date reforms to the commonhold system to allow that to replace the leasehold system."" Conservative peer Lord Young, a former minister, said he welcomed the bill but that it did not do what Housing Secretary Michael Gove originally promised - to ""liberate people"" from ""an outdated, feudal system"". He suggested peers could amend the legislation to deliver this aim. Another Tory peer, Lord Cormack also suggested the House of Lords could ""put right what [Mr Gove] has not yet got right"". Baroness Penn insisted the bill was focused on ""helping leaseholders now"" by making existing leases fairer and more affordable. Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, said reform was ""long overdue"" and banning leasehold houses was ""low-hanging fruit"". Ms Kendrick, who is also a Labour councillor, urged the government to go further and also ban new leasehold flats. The majority of leasehold homes in England are flats and the proportion of new-build houses sold as leaseholds has fallen from a 15% high in 2016 to just 1% in December 2022. Campaigner Harry Scoffin, who launched the Free Leaseholders group last week to call for the bill to be strengthened, said he understood some Tory MPs were also concerned the bill did not go far enough on flats and were considering proposing their own changes. Labour has said it would back such moves but without government support they are unlikely to succeed. The party has said it would make commonhold ""the default tenure for all new properties"" if it wins power. Mr Scoffin said: ""It is clear that it will be up to the next administration to bring commonhold out of the deep freeze, but it's not too late for this government to require 'share of freehold' on new apartment schemes, which is a tried and tested arrangement that gives residents control of their costs and service providers from day one. ""Such a positive change is simple to do and would be cost neutral to the Treasury."" Under share of freehold, a flat still has a lease but there is greater control over how the building is managed. On Tuesday it emerged a promised ban on the sale of new leasehold houseshad not been included in the bill introduced to Parliament earlier this week. However, the government said this would be added at a later stage in its passage through Parliament. Baroness Penn told peers leasehold reform was ""complex"" and ""we're taking the time to get things right"". She added: ""I do understand the desirability of bringing forward these clauses as soon as possible for Parliament's scrutiny and that's what the government intends to do.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/thomas-accused-insulting-francophones-1.7044958,"Quick Links Conservative MP accused of insulting francophones by asking minister to speak English MP Rachael Thomas later apologized in writing Social Sharing A Conservative member of Parliament from Alberta was accused of undermining bilingualism and insulting francophone Canadians after she asked a cabinet minister from Quebec to speak in English during an appearance before a parliamentary committee. ""For the Conservatives to put in question official bilingualism is absolutely reprehensible,"" NDP MP Peter Julian told the committee. ""I just can't believe how radical and extreme this party has become since the member from Carleton [Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre] took over."" The incident unfolded during a meeting of the House of Commons heritage committee Thursday morning. Rachael Thomas, the Conservative MP for Lethbridge, asked Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge, a francophone who represents the Quebec riding of Brome—Missisquoi, for an English answer to her questions. ""Minister, I noticed that you answered my questions in French, but other questions you answered in English if they're from your Liberal colleagues. I realize it's completely your choice, we're a bilingual country, but if at all possible I'd love to have an English answer,"" Thomas said. That request kicked off a flurry of protests from NDP, Bloc and Liberal MPs on the committee, who accused Thomas of insulting francophones and Quebeckers. Alberta MP accused of insulting francophones during committee Bloc MP Martin Champoux said House of Commons committees have ""highly efficient"" interpreters. ""The minister has the full right to answer in whichever language she chooses. This is an insult to Quebeckers and to francophones,"" he said. Liberal MP Michael Coteau, who represents the Ontario riding of Don Valley-East, said Thomas's request ""goes against everything this country has been built on."" ""That should never happen at committee, it should never happen in the House of Commons and [it] is something that goes against our very values as Canadians,"" he said. In response, Thomas said she was not provided the ""opportunity"" to receive an English answer and asked again if St-Onge ""would be willing to answer in English."" Julian said that as an anglophone who learned French in school, he knows there are times when the vocabulary of one language is better than another because it allows one to ""speak more easily."" ""I certainly hope that this MP will start respecting official languages and respecting this committee,"" he said. Committee chair and Liberal MP Hedy Fry ruled that the minister is free to speak in the language of her choice. ""If the minister chooses French, fine. If the minister chooses English, fine. We cannot make her answer in whatever,"" Fry said. Thomas sends apology to committee chair On her way into question period, St-Onge said Thomas's comments were inappropriate and she will continue to speak in her mother tongue while executing her duties. ""I will never question one of my colleagues who wants to speak French or English,"" she said. ""I thought it was really inappropriate and disrespectful to French people and Quebec people."" Watch: St-Onge says Alberta MP's request for answers in English was 'inappropriate': St-Onge says Alberta MP's request for answers in English was 'inappropriate' Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet responded with a reference to a poem by Canadian writer Michèle Lalond calledSpeak White,about the oppression of francophones in Canada. ""It is good oldSpeak White: 'I am an English Canadian therefore I am somewhat superior to you, you should speak English to me,'"" Blanchet said outside the House of Commons. ""It's a lack of respect which does not surprise anybody in Quebec any more."" On Thursday afternoon, Thomas wrote to Fry saying that her party does support bilingualism and the ""right of Canadians to communicate in the language of their choice.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/detroit-street-can-charge-electric-vehicles-1.7044888,"Quick Links This Detroit street can charge EVs as they drive Copper inductive coils allow vehicles with receivers to charge batteries while driving Social Sharing Crews have installed what's billed as the first wireless-charging public roadway in the U.S. for electric vehicles. It's beneath a street just west of downtown Detroit. Copper inductive charging coils allow vehicles equipped with receivers to charge up their batteries while driving, idling or parking above the coils. The segment of 14th Street will be used to test and perfect the technology ahead of making it available to the public within a few years, according to the Michigan Department of Transportation. Demonstrations were held Wednesday at Michigan Central innovation district, a hub for advancing technologies and programs that address barriers to mobility. The district also is where Ford is restoring the old Michigan Central train station to develop self-driving vehicles. The technology belongs to Electreon, an Israel-based developer of wireless charging solutions for electric vehicles. The company has contracts for similar roadways in Israel, Sweden, Italy and Germany. The pilot initiative in Michigan was announced in 2021. ""Alongside Michigan's automotive expertise, we'll demonstrate how wireless charging unlocks widespread EV adoption, addressing limited range, grid limitations, and battery size and costs,"" said Stefan Tongur, Electreon vice president of business development. ""This project paves the way for a zero-emission mobility future, where EVs are the norm, not the exception."" When a vehicle with a receiver nears the charging segments, the coils beneath the road transfer electricity through a magnetic field, charging the vehicle's battery. The coils only activate when a vehicle with a receiver passes over them. Tongur told reporters the roadway is safe for pedestrians, motorists and animals. The state department of transportation and Electreon made a five-year commitment to develop the electric road system and is expected to seek bids to rebuild part of busy Michigan Avenue, where inductive charging will also be installed.  As electric vehicles increase in popularity, the Biden administration has made its plan for half a million EV charging stations a signature piece of its infrastructure goals. The wireless-charging roadway helps put Michigan and Detroit at the forefront of electric vehicle technology, officials said.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/un-cop28-record-heat-1.7040807,"Quick Links 2023 set to be hottest year on record, UN says World Meteorological agency says El Niño could make next year warmer still Heat is a lot worse in cities. Here's how to fix them Social Sharing The United Nations weather agency said Thursday that 2023 is all but certain to be the hottest year on record, warning of worrying trends that suggest increasing floods, wildfires, glacier melt and heat waves in the future. The World Meteorological Organization also warned that the average temperature for the year is up some 1.4 degrees C from pre-industrial times — a mere one-tenth of a degree under a target limit for the end of the century as laid out by the Paris climate accord in 2015. The WMO secretary general said the onset earlier this year of El Niño, the weather phenomenon marked by heating in the Pacific Ocean, could tip the average temperature next year over the 1.5-degree (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target cap set in Paris. ""It's practically sure that during the coming four years we will hit this 1.5, at least on [a] temporary basis,"" Petteri Taalas said in an interview. ""And in the next decade we are more or less going to be there on a permanent basis."" WMO issued the findings for Thursday's start of the UN's annual climate conference, this year being held in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates city of Dubai. Recent years warmest on record The UN agency said the benchmark of the key Paris accord goal will be whether the 1.5-degree increase is sustained over a 30-year span – not just a single year – but others say the world needs more clarity on that. ""Clarity on breaching the Paris agreement guardrails will be crucial,"" said Richard Betts of Britain's Met Office, the lead author of a new paper on the issue with University of Exeter published in the journal Nature. ""Without an agreement on what actually will count as exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius, we risk distraction and confusion at precisely the time when action to avoid the worst effects of climate change becomes even more urgent,"" he added. Is it possible to be a green oil giant? The U.A.E. thinks so WMO's Taalas said that whatever the case, the world appears on course to blow well past that figure anyway. ""We are heading towards 2.5 to 3 degrees warming and that would mean that we would see massively more negative impacts of climate change,"" Taalas said, pointing to glacier loss and sea level rise over ""the coming thousands of years."" The nine years 2015 to 2023 were the warmest on record, WMO said. Its findings for this year run through October, but it says the last two months are not likely to be enough to keep 2023 from being a record-hot year. Still, there are ""some signs of hope"" — including a turn toward renewable energies and more electric cars, which help reduce the amount of carbon that is spewed into the atmosphere, trapping heat inside,"" Taalas said. His message for attendees at the UN climate conference? ""We have to reduce our consumption of coal, oil and natural gas dramatically to be able to limit the warming to the Paris limits,"" he said. ""Luckily, things are happening. But still, we in the Western countries, in the rich countries, we are still consuming oil, a little bit less coal than in the past, and still natural gas."" ""Reduction of fossil fuel consumption — that's the key to success."" Footer Links My Account Connect with CBC Contact CBC Audience Relations, CBCP.O.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-hamas-temporary-truce-extended-1.7044586,"Quick Links Hostage releases resume as Israel, Hamas extend Gaza temporary truce Gaza hostilities still on pause; Hamas gunmen kill 3 people in Israel Social Sharing Two Israeli women have been handed to the Red Cross in Gaza City, Israel said on Thursday, and further hostages are expected to be released later in the evening, following a last-minute deal struck by Israel and Hamas. Israel named the women as 21-year-old Mia Schem, who was seized at a dance party along with many of the other hostages abducted into Gaza, and 40-year-old Amit Sosana. Last month, Hamas released an undated video that featured Schem, who also holds French citizenship, with a bandaged right arm. Her father David told Israel's Channel 12 TV on Thursday that when they meet, he will not say a word to her. ""I don't want to ask her questions, because I don't know what she endured."" Earlier, the warring sides agreed to extend their ceasefire for a seventh day, while mediators pressed on with talks to extend the truce further to free more hostages and let aid reach Gaza. The truce has let some humanitarian aid into Gaza after much of the coastal territory of 2.3 million people was reduced to wasteland by seven weeks of Israeli bombardment in retaliation for a deadly rampage by Hamas militants on Oct. 7. Israel, which has demanded Hamas release at least 10 hostages per day to keep the ceasefire going, said it received a list at the last minute of those who would go free on Thursday, allowing it to call off plans to resume fighting at dawn. ""In light of the mediators' efforts to continue the process of releasing the hostages and subject to the terms of the framework, the operational pause will continue,"" the Israeli military said in a statement, released minutes before the truce was due to expire. Hamas, which freed 16 hostages on Wednesday while Israel released 30 people held in Palestinian prisons, also said the truce would continue for a seventh day. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on his third visit to the Middle East since the war began, said efforts were continuing to prolong the truce. ""We have seen over the last week the very positive development of hostages coming home, being reunited with their families. And that should continue today,"" he said during a meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog. ""It's also enabled an increase in humanitarian assistance to go to innocent civilians in Gaza who need it desperately. So this process is producing results. It's important, and we hope that it can continue."" Heading into Thursday, 97 people among some 240 hostages had been released: 70 Israeli women and children, each freed in return for three Palestinian women and teenage detainees, plus 27 foreign hostages freed under parallel agreements with their governments. With fewer Israeli women and children left in captivity, extending the truce could require setting new terms for the release of Israeli men, including soldiers. Palestinian family in Khan Younis displacement camp says, 'we suffer for everything' Hamas claims deadly attack in Jerusalem Shortly after the agreement was extended, Israeli police said two Palestinian attackers opened fire at a bus stop during morning rush hour at the entrance to Jerusalem, killing three people. Both attackers were ""neutralized,"" police said. Hamas claimed as its members the two gunmen, saying in a statement that ""the operation came as a natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the occupation,"" citing Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the treatment of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Security camera footage obtained by Reuters shows a white car stopping beside the crowded bus stop. Two men then step out, guns drawn, and charge at the crowd as people scatter. Shortly afterwards, the Palestinian attackers are themselves shot. The slain victims were identified by Israeli media as a woman in her 20s, a woman in her 60s and a 74-year-old rabbi. As well, the Israeli military said it intercepted an ""aerial target"" that crossed from Lebanon on Thursday. Reuters witnesses heard blasts along the southeastern Lebanese frontier. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for any attacks from Lebanon. The conditions of the ceasefire, including the halt of hostilities and the entry of humanitarian aid, remain the same, according to a Qatar Foreign Ministry spokesperson. Qatar has been a key mediator between the warring sides, along with Egypt and the United States. Israel has sworn to annihilate Hamas, which rules Gaza, in response to the Oct. 7 rampage by the militant group, when Israel says gunmen killed 1,200 people, including several Canadians. Until the truce, Israel bombarded the territory for seven weeks. Palestinian health authorities deemed reliable by the United Nations say more than 15,000 Gazans have been confirmed killed, around 40 per cent of them children. A further 6,500 are missing, many feared still buried under rubble. Two-thirds of Gazans are homeless, most sheltering in the south after Israel ordered the complete evacuation of the northern half of the tiny coastal strip. Once the truce is over, Israel is expected to extend its ground campaign into the south. 'What is a truce that doesn't bring us back home?' Gazans have been able to use the week-long truce to venture out, visit abandoned and destroyed homes, and dig scores more bodies out of the wreckage. But residents and international agencies say the aid that has arrived so far is still trivial compared to the besieged enclave's vast humanitarian needs. Those who fled the north of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, have still been blocked from returning. Many thousands of families are sleeping rough in makeshift shelters with only the belongings they could carry. ""What is a truce that doesn't bring us back home? Israeli soldiers on tanks fired at us when we tried to go back to check on our homes in Gaza City after we heard it was bombed,"" said Mohammad Joudat, 25, a displaced business administration graduate, speaking in Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip. The United States, which has strongly backed its ally so far, is urging Israel to narrow the zone of combat and clarify where Palestinian civilians can seek safety during any Israeli operation in southern Gaza, U.S. officials said on Wednesday, to prevent a repeat of the massive death toll so far. Meanwhile, Jordan is set to host a conference attended by the main UN, regional and international relief agencies on Thursday to co-ordinate aid to Gaza, official media said.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-gdp-economy-1.7044651,"Quick Links Canada's economy shrank by 0.3% in third quarter, StatsCan says Upward revision of numbers for previous quarter now show growth Social Sharing Canada's economy shrank in the three months up to September, as household spending was flat and exports declined. Statistics Canada reported Thursday that the country's gross domestic product shrank by 0.3 per cent. Exports fell by 1.3 per cent and imports declined by 0.2 per cent. Household spending was flat for the second quarter in a row, and after five consecutive quarterly declines, housing investment increased by two per cent in the quarter. The data agency previously reported that the three-month period up to June also saw a slight decline, so Thursday's numbers would have been the second consecutive quarterly contraction in a row, and meet the bar that some experts say is the requirement for a recession. But the data agency revised its April-to-June numbers higher than initially reported, and now says the economy grew by 0.3 per cent that quarter. Doug Porter, an economist with Bank of Montreal, said that the upward revision of the April-to-June numbers makes recessionary talk premature, but regardless, the numbers paint a picture of an economy that isn't really expanding. ""Whatever label you slap on this economy, it's basically not growing, despite the artificial sweetener of rapid population growth,"" he said. ""The big picture is that the Canadian economy is struggling to grow, yet managing to just keep its head above recession waters."" The weak GDP numbers make it a virtual certainty that the Bank of Canada will see no need to raise interest rates any time soon, starting with its next policy decision next week. Derek Holt, an economist with Scotiabank, says the numbers aren't as bleak as the headline contraction would suggest, and much of the weakness stems from short-term factors. ""Half the country was literally on fire over the summer and those wildfires disrupted a broad cross-section of economic activity from shut mines and petrochemical facilities to agriculture, forestry and tourism under the warm glow of orange skies,"" he said. Ultimately, he doesn't see any evidence that a recession is underway. ""The economy is not in recession as some folks across [Bay] Street have been claiming,"" he said. ""The recessionistas have some explaining to do and the Bank of Canada won't see enough in here to guide easing any time soon.""

https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/hockey-canada-maltreatment-report-1.7045173,"Quick Links Hockey Canada says almost 1,900 maltreatment complaints received in 2022-23 Organization says 187 of those complaints were accepted, fully processed Social Sharing Hockey Canada says a new independent third-party complaint mechanism received information on almost 1,900 potential cases of maltreatment during its first season. The data is contained in the national sport organization's latest report on the issue — which covers abuse, discrimination and harassment — released today as part of its numbers-based push to address the problem across the game. Hockey Canada says of the 1,872 complaints made during the 2022-23 season, 187 were accepted and fully processed, while more than 1,400 didn't meet the threshold of severity and were redirected to provincial or territorial members for assessment. Of the accepted complaints, the report entitled ""Tracking Maltreatment in Sanctioned Hockey"" showed just over 50 per cent involved bullying and harassment, followed by sexual maltreatment (19.8 per cent), physical abuse (11.2 per cent), discrimination (7.5 per cent) and abuse of power (seven per cent). Put differently, that's an average of nearly one complaint per 200 players across the country. The report also stated there were 1,624 documented or alleged incidents of on-ice discrimination last season — up from the 927 contained in Hockey Canada's first report on maltreatment related to 2021-22. The sport body pointed to improved awareness, education and reporting processes as potential reasons for the overall increases. The 18-page document also showed that the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner received 25 complaints or reports related to hockey, although 24 of those were deemed inadmissible and one was pending as of June 30, 2023. Hockey Canada, which is still recovering from a string of scandals related to alleged sexual abuse, became a full signatory of the government-backed Abuse-Free Sport program in October 2022.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/domtar-plant-remediation-edmonton-contamination-1.7038845,"Quick Links They live near a former wood treatment plant. Now they anxiously await results of a cancer investigation 'We were hoping the government would help us but they have abandoned us' Social Sharing Dume Bera wades through waist-high weeds as he steps into his backyard for the first time in years. His children watch from inside the house, behind windows that are always shut tight. No one in Bera's household ever touches the soil. A married father of three, the 43-year-old Bera is afraid of the contaminated soil found near his northeast Edmonton home and what it means for the health of his family. ""I worry. I worry every day about my sons,"" he says as walks along an overgrown fenceline affixed with a warning sign. ""We were hoping the government would help us, but they have abandoned us."" Bera's home overlooks a former Domtar wood treatment plant, which is now slated to become a new neighbourhood. Remediation work on the former creosote plant — now an empty field north of Yellowhead Trail and south of Hermitage Road — was approved this month by Alberta Environment. Despite the completed cleanup, people living near the site continue to wait for answers about what the industrial history of their neighbourhood means for their future health. An epidemiological investigation into elevated rates of cancer found among nearby residents is now more than three years overdue, with no timeline for completion. Reports suggest the area where Bera's home now stands was once used for the storage of raw, untreated wood. But testing in his backyard found dangerous concentrations of toxic chemicals. 'Losing hope' Bera said crews cleaning up the site offered to excavate part of his yard. But he didn't want his family in the home when the soil was dug up; his yard remains untouched. He said his children often struggle to breathe, and frequent hospital visits have left him wondering if the soil is making them sick. ""I am losing hope,"" he said. ""They said they would help us … but they abandoned my family."" The delay of the health study is the latest frustration for area residents in a decades-long battle over contamination found on the brownfield site. The plant operated from 1924 until 1987, using toxic preservatives such as creosote to treat railway ties, telephone poles and other wood products. Chemical waste seeped deep into the soil. Domtar officials declined an interview request. The company no longer owns the land. Cherokee Canada Inc., the new owner, declined comment but has long maintained the site is safe. In 2018, more than 100 area residents received letters warning them that their homes were near contaminated lands. Fences were put up, along with signs warning that the soil was toxic with hazardous levels of dioxins, furans and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The following year, the province announced a cancer study after an initial assessment identified elevated cancer rates in people who lived near the former plant. An association was found between a longer length of residency and certain types of cancer — breast and endometrial cancer in women, and lung cancer in men. Soil testing also showed more than 180 samples from nearly 1,500 specimens had levels of toxins exceeding health guidelines. The province promised a more thorough investigation into why residents were at an elevated risk and if contamination from the plant was to blame. WATCH | Edmontonians living near former Domtar plant call for accountability: Residents near former wood treatment plant anxious for answers Alberta Health, Alberta Health Services and the Public Health Agency of Canada launched the study. Federal epidemiologists were dispatched to Edmonton in 2019 to begin the work. Results of the study were to be made public by spring 2020. What progress has been made to date remains unclear. In a statement, Alberta Health blamed the ongoing delays on the COVID-19 pandemic. It said an epidemiologist at the University of Alberta will analyze the research before results are subjected to scientific peer review. ""We remain committed to completing the epidemiological study and will release the findings publicly when they are ready,"" an Alberta Health spokesperson said. After the Domtar plant closed, there was some remediation, including excavation work in nearby backyards. But millions of tonnes of contaminated earth remained. Cherokee, a Toronto-based firm that specializes in redeveloping brownfield sites, purchased the plant lands in 2010 and planned to turn the area into a residential development. Some homes, including Bera's, were built to the west of the main plant property but Cherokee was soon locked in a regulatory fight to continue the build. In 2016, following an investigation into the construction of a 900-metre-long berm on site, the province ordered Domtar and Cherokee to immediately remove all contaminated material. The berm – 40 metres wide and four metres tall – was constructed with contaminated soil, according to site inspection reports. Cherokee and Domtar appealed the order on grounds that a cleanup, estimated to cost $52 million, was unnecessary. Alberta's Environmental Appeals Board sided with the companies. The board ruled that removing all contaminated soil from the site would put pose a higher risk to human health — that it would be safer to bury some of the polluted soil deeper in the ground. In 2019, Shannon Phillips, Alberta's environment minister at the time, accepted the recommendations and quashed the previous orders. Phillips issued a new ministerial order and new environmental protection orders outlining remediation plans, including timelines for dust control and health risk assessments. In the fall of 2022, remediation began on four parcels, including a city-owned greenbelt and the now-empty plant lands that are slated for infill development. Alberta Environment signed off this month on the cleanup of the lands slated for infill development. Excavation of contaminated soils has been completed and deemed acceptable, the ministry said. More than 95,000 tonnes of soil with the highest levels of contamination was trucked away. Soil with low levels of contamination was used to backfill an excavation site where there are no plans for future residential development. The province said risk management and long-term monitoring plans, completed last year, will manage the risk of residual contamination and ensure polluted soil buried on site is not disturbed. Groundwater samples will be taken from 32 wells each year. Soil vapour samples will be collected twice annually. If the sampling indicates ""unexpected concentrations"" of contaminants, corrective actions will be taken, the province said. It said monitoring reports will be provided to community members on request. ""Management of contamination below the recreational areas of the bermed soils and the greenbelt areas is considered possible without causing adverse effect,"" the province said. Decisions about how and when the land can be redeveloped now rest with the City of Edmonton. The city said it has has received an application for rezoning of the former Domtar lands to residential, parks and public utility development. City officials said a team with expertise in contaminated sites would typically be involved in reviewing development proposals for properties with a known history of contamination. However, in this case, Alberta Environment was solely responsible for ensuring remediation was completed, the city said. Remediation has also wrapped up on a city-owned greenbelt in the Overlanders neighbourhood that was formerly the site of a series of wastewater ditches for the plant. In August, an environmental protection order for the greenbelt was rescinded. Fences that had kept residents out for years came down in early November. Coreen Sheridan, whose home of 18 years backs onto the property, said communication about remediation has been sporadic and the greenbelt was opened to public access without notice. She once fed her family from a vegetable garden on the lot; her children played there. Sheridan said she was relieved to see the fences come down but wants a clearer picture of the health risks her family may have faced. ""My husband fought cancer twice since those fences went up,"" she said. ""Is it because of where we've lived that he got this? I don't know that there's ever going to be evidence or proof, whether it is or it isn't."" In a statement to CBC, Alberta Health Services said risk to public health from the greenbelt is now considered low. Sheridan said she has lost confidence in Cherokee, the province and the city. She said residents deserve more transparency around testing, and for the results of the cancer study to be made public. ""They told us that it was such a hazard, that we were living right next to this horrible zone that you can't go into,"" she said. ""Now, all of a sudden, they've determined this is safe? But they haven't communicated that to us. They haven't told us what they found or reassured us that it is a safe place.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/john-risley-saf-1.7030340,"Quick Links John Risley doubles down on sustainable aviation fuel with California plant expansion Sustainable aviation fuel touted as means of fuelling planes with lower emission fuel Social Sharing For the last seven years, John Risley's company World Energy has been producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a low emissions liquid fuel used in commercial aviation. Now he's aiming to quintuple production at its Paramount, Calif., facility. SAF has a carbon footprint 80 per cent less than conventional fossil fuel and is made from non-petroleum feedstock, like fats and greases. ""There's over 110 billion gallons of jet fuel consumed on an annual basis globally. So it's a big market,"" Risley said while speaking to CBC News from an airport in Seoul. World Energy's Paramount facility sits on 75 acres and Risley's said its $3.5-billion expansion started a year and a half ago. The company is halfway through the process now. When it's done, its SAF output will quintuple. ""We're undergoing a significant expansion of that of the plant now, from 5,000 barrels a day to 25,000 barrels a day,"" he said. The facility is also located about 16 kilometres from the Los Angeles International Airport, where World Energy's SAF is deposited into the airport's fuel depot. SAF takes carbon dioxide out of atmosphere The International Civil Aviation Organization has set a target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Paul I. Williams, National Centre for Atmospheric Science senior research fellow at the University of Manchester, said the sector won't reach that goal by burning standard fossil fuels. ""So it's looking at a range of different scenarios which include different technologies, which could be things like electric and other fuels,"" he told CBC News. ""One of the biggest proportions in the medium term is sustainable aviation fuels. So it's going to hopefully play quite a big part moving forward."" Williams added there are different ways to produce SAF, including using garden waste and growing plans to process it into SAF, among other pathways. He said the challenge is scaling up in order to produce enough fuel to meet the aviation sector's needs. ""That's when it becomes a challenge because there's only so much waste to go around."" He said when people talk about becoming carbon neutral, it isn't about producing less carbon dioxide than current amount, but rather recycling it in the atmosphere. ""That's a massive store of carbon,"" he said, referring to fossil fuels that have been buried in the ground. ""We process that and burn it. In doing so we produce CO2 and that's like new CO2 going into the atmosphere."" He explained SAF production takes that carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, reprocesses it, turns it into fuel, and transforms it back as carbon dioxide. Williams also said there are many different ""road maps"" to reaching net zero emissions and that SAF will play a large role. Growing green credit market Tied to World Energy's SAF production business is also green credits, an incentive for companies to reduce carbon emissions. Risley said for every SAF gallon they produce it generates a green credit unit, which they can sell separately. ""If somebody wants to fuel their aircraft In Seattle? OK, then they can buy a credit from us without actually transporting the fuel to Seattle, which would be… carbon intensive in its own right."" ""So the best way to do that is to use the fuel as close to the source of production as possible and then sell the credit for using the fuel to whoever wants to buy it."" As companies commit to reaching net zero, the market for green credits will grow, Risley said. He pointed to companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Apple that have committed to specific target emissions, and they will need to find companies producing green credits to meet those goals. ""So companies like Microsoft who have made a commitment to decarbonize. How do they decarbonize? Well they buy credits from companies like us."" Investment into green energy Risley says this venture predates his investment in the wind hydrogen business. World Energy GH2 — of which he is chairman — plans to build at least 328 wind turbines on the Port au Port Peninsula and nearby Codroy Valley along with a hydrogen-ammonia plant. In October the provincial governmentasked the companyto provide more information on a series of potential impacts. ""So it predates our investment in the hydrogen business in Newfoundland. And in fact, it was the precursor to that investment because if you make SAF, you are a big user of hydrogen,"" he said. ""And we wanted to find a source of clean or green hydrogen, which is what led us initially to the development in Newfoundland."" World Energy also lent its name to World Energy GH2, the hydrogen project, which he called ""a different corporate vehicle."" He added he'd been eyeing the green energy transition for the last 10 years and was looking for opportunities to invest in new technologies and ""new pathways to produce greener fuels,"" which led him to SAF. Between SAF and his interests in wind hydrogen production, he said he's invested in the green energy transition. ""I think it's a big, really big deal. And if you believe in climate change, it's a place that people should be paying attention to.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cree-fiddle-chisasibi-soldier-s-joy-wedding-1.7040999,"Quick Links Cree elder has been playing fiddle for 70 years — and opened his grandson's wedding with 1st tune he learned Malcolm House, 82, played 'Soldier's Joy' at wedding last month in Chisasibi Social Sharing Malcolm House was 12 years old when he first started playing the fiddle in northern Quebec Cree territory, back in 1953. At the time, he had to go visit a friend and play his fiddle, because House didn't have one of his own. Seventy years later, House is still fiddling — and last month, he played the first fiddle tune of the evening at an important family event in Chisasibi, in northern Quebec. Playing the first tune, before the dancing starts, is an important Cree custom. ""I played at my grandson's wedding, I played the fiddle at the dance,"" House said, in Cree. The 82-year-old elder playedSoldier's Joy, a classic fiddle reel with origins traced back to Scotland. Cree elder played the first fiddle tune at his grandson Rusty's wedding in Chisasibi last month. Soldier's Joywas also the first fiddle tune House learned to play back in 1953. He said fiddle music has long been a standard at Cree weddings. House said he used to play with the late Ray Spencer, a legendary fiddler in James Bay who died in 1982. Spencer was featured as part of National Film Board'sThe Fiddlers of James Bay, a 1980 documentary that traces the history of the fiddle's arrival in Canada with Scottish traders, 300 years ago. House and his wife Sarah live a mostly traditional life at their camp, located at Kaa Weeshinaawkimaach — a lake inland from Chisasibi and accessible only by snowmobile or plane. The couple also has a camp closer to Chisasibi, which is accessible by road. ""It's forEeyou Ituun,"" said Sarah in Cree, which translates into 'Cree knowledge'. Sarah said House often plays the fiddle at their traditional camp, and that she was happy to hear him playing at their grandson's wedding. It is customary for couples to have embroidered moose skin hearts made when they get married and the lead fiddle player to drape them on their fiddle. ""I used to enjoy listening to him play at our cabin, I used to think how could he play that instrument … I used to see him play at the dance a long time ago. He was a very good fiddler,"" Sarah said.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/university-of-ottawa-workday-pay-issues-1.7031104,"Quick Links Switch to cloud-based HR system creates storm of problems for U of O Workday and university spokespeople say nothing wrong with the system Social Sharing Working students and professors are dealing with what they call an ""institutional failure"" by the University of Ottawa after it switched to a new finance and HR system earlier this year — a move they said has caused an onslaught of problems, including employees being underpaid, overpaid or not being paid at all. Students and teachers told CBC the problems are campus-wide, affecting every department at the school since it launched Workday, a cloud-based system for payroll, scheduling and other human resource needs. The system is developed by Workday Inc., a NASDAQ-traded company with revenues of more than $6.2 billion US last year alone. Students and professors said the problems with Workday have caused overwhelming financial difficulties for many, particularly for temporary, part-time and contract workers — with no solutions in sight. ""It doesn't seem to be getting better and we are really at a loss as to what to do,"" said Audrey Giles, a professor in the faculty of health sciences. University administration and Workday representatives declined CBC's requests for interviews, but spokespeople for both said there was nothing wrong with the system itself. ""The experience has been seamless for the great majority of user accounts, and the new software is functioning as modelled,"" said university spokesperson Jesse Robichaud. ""However, we remain in the expected transition phase, with user input errors causing the bulk of the reported delays."" An unidentified Workday spokesperson said ""payment issues referenced are non-technical in nature and unrelated to the Workday system."" University employees argue staff were ill prepared for the change and are calling on administration to fix the problems as soon as possible. Ongoing pay problems Prior to Workday, the university had several HR systems in place that varied across departments. According to an article posted on the school's website last year, the switch to a new system was an effort ""to maximize efficiency."" It promised an ""easier"" HR program for employees — one already adopted by several other post-secondary institutions across Canada and the U.S. Workday is also used by the CBC. Giles said Workday has been anything but easy since its launch in May. ""All of a sudden it was impossible to see our research accounts. It was taking months to get any sort of contracts filled for people to be employed and then also for dollars to flow,"" she said. Catherine Larocque, president of CUPE 2626 — which represents student workers including teaching assistants, research assistants, residence workers and lifeguards — said the union has received dozens of complaints about pay problems since the start of the fall semester. There were delays in issuing contracts. Some students weren't getting paid. Some were underpaid while others were getting paid too much and then being asked to repay upwards of $5,000, she said. Impacts on livelihood and mental health The issues have led to issues paying bills, paying rent and affording groceries, said Larocque, adding there's been a significant increase in students needing to access the union's emergency fund. ""This has caused significant levels of mental distress,"" she said. ""Not being able to pay your bills, not knowing when you're going to get paid, especially when you're paycheque to paycheque, you can't function. You can't focus on your studies."" Luc Angers, vice-president of the Association of Part-Time Professors at the university, said his office has also been ""inundated"" with calls from members. He said hundreds of part-time professors have faced similar issues: not getting paid or only receiving partial pay for their work. Another major challenge, Angers said, is that technical difficulties with Workday meant professors weren't able to apply for some contracts. ""It's a bad change when you hinder the opportunity for people to get to live and to cut on their finances, to cut on their quality of work,"" he said. U of O says it's working out issues Unions and a number of faculty deans said they have expressed their concerns with university administration for months. ""It has been escalated in every way possible, which is why I think people are feeling a real sense of distress right now,"" said Giles, who has stopped recruiting grad students or applying for grants until the issues are resolved. In a statement to CBC, Robichaud said the implementation of Workday was ""an important step"" in modernizing its administrative services. He said the university has been working with students and managers to explain the new system since the launch. That includes training ""on the importance of recording and approving hours on time."" ""We recognize the impacts of delays and other problems, and are working to urgently address them as they are identified,"" said Robichaud. Giles said training has been ""inadequate"" and resolutions aren't happening fast enough. ""The rate at which they correct things is still slower than the rate at which we find problems with it,"" she said. ""It feels a lot like institutional failure.""

https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/ozempic-shortages-first-nations-1.7041324,"Quick Links Global Ozempic shortage affects First Nations people with diabetes Health Canada says Ozempic shortages could last until March 2024 Social Sharing The global shortage of the diabetes medication Ozempic has diabetics like Eleanor Michael from Sipekne'katik worried about finding alternatives. Ozempic has seen a skyrocketing global demand,in part due to prescriptions related to weight loss. Michael, whose Mi'kmaw community is about 50 kilometres northwest of Halifax, was diagnosed with diabetes earlier this year and prescribed the drug but now she can't fill her prescription. ""[Ozempic] was keeping my sugars down,"" Michael said. She said she's scared to try other medications, because arthritis medicine she also takes increases her blood sugar levels. First Nations people living on-reserve have rates of diabetesthree to five times higherthan non-Indigenous people in  Canada, according to the Government of Canada. Michael said Ozempic was helping curb her appetite for unhealthy foods. She took a break in the summer for two weeks to see how her body would respond to the arthritis medication, but once her blood sugar climbed she went back on it. She said she'll continue to work with her pharmacist and doctor to come up with a game plan to maintain her health but also worries about putting on weight without Ozempic. Cheryl Gehue, band councillor for Sipekne'katik and a diabetic herself, said Ozempic worked well to help her control her blood sugar levels. Gehue said she ran out of Ozempic two weeks ago and although alternative drugs like Trulicity were offered, it wasn't covered by the Non-Insured Health Benefits program that helps cover the cost of prescriptions for First Nations and Inuit patients. ""There needs to be a strategy put in place for once [Ozempic] comes back on the market on how to roll it out within our First Nations communities,"" said Gehue, 54. In an email, Health Canada said it was working closely with Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, to monitor supplies but shortages are expected to continue until March 31, 2024. Janet Gordon, COO of the Sioux Lookout First Nations Health Authority, said she had a family member go months without filling their Ozempic prescription. Gordon said her organization serves over 30 First Nations communities in northern Ontario, many of which are isolated and struggle to keep health-care workers and a flow of prescription medication. ""It makes it harder for the continuity of care and we have seen that in diabetes care for sure,"" said Gordon. She said they have to rely on public health nurses to teach diabetic education and if a patient requires dialysis they often have to leave their community. Gordan said they have developed a regional strategy for diabetic care, to ensure people stay in community for culturally safe and integrated care but it lacks adequate funding to implement. There are still barriers to healthy eating and lifestyle changes in First Nations communities such aspoverty ratesandfood insecurity, said Sharon Rudderham, director of health transformation for Tajikeimɨk, a Mi'kmaw health organization, but she encourages people to keep trying. ""People can just try their best and look at alternatives that might be more affordable,"" said Rudderham.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/oil-revenues-taxes-nudge-up-alberta-s-projected-surplus-to-5-5b-1.7045166,"Quick Links Oil revenues, taxes nudge up Alberta's projected surplus to $5.5B Improved forecast should lead to higher debt repayments this year Social Sharing Higher-than expected revenue from income taxes and non-renewable resource revenues are bumping Alberta's expected surplus up to $5.5 billion this year, the province's latest financial statements say. ""Alberta continues to stand out as a leader when it comes to fiscal stability and economic resilience in the midst of so much global uncertainty,"" Finance Minister Nate Horner said in a press release Thursday. Rebounding oil prices, a narrower-than-expected gap between the price of Canadian oil and the U.S. benchmark, and one extra project paying oil royalties at a higher rate all helped to improve the province's projected revenue by $3.7 billion more than February's budget predicted. The second-quarter update, released Thursday, shows planned expenses for the year are up 0.7 per cent, and include additional spending on health care, advanced education, mental health and addiction and education. A law introduced earlier this year that set new rules for how the government must manage its finances requires leaders to dedicate half of any surplus to paying down debt. That would send $3.2 billion to debt payments this year, leaving Alberta with $76.1 billion in taxpayer-supported debt by fiscal year's end. Another $1.6 billion in surplus will flow into the Alberta Fund, a new savings account the government also created this year. Officials said there is no immediate plan to spend that money. An extraordinary wildfire season and punishing drought that hammered livestock producers prompted the government to spend most of its $1.5-billion disaster contingency fund in the first six months of the fiscal year. Complete elimination of the provincial gas tax is ending come Jan. 1, 2024. However, a program to provide relief at the pumps based on the price of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil will continue. The provincial gas tax is usually 13 cents per litre if the price of WTI is below $80 US per barrel. That price will be nine cents per litre at most, for the first three months of 2024, to prevent sticker shock, the province says. If the WTI price exceeds $80 US per barrel, the gas tax will be nine cents per litre. If the price is higher than $85 US/bbl, the tax is 4.5 cents per litre. And if the oil price exceeds $90 US/bbl, the gas tax is eliminated. More to come… ABOUT THE AUTHOR Provincial affairs reporter Janet French covers the Alberta Legislature for CBC Edmonton.

https://www.euronews.com/2023/11/30/russia-supreme-court-bans-lgbt-movement-for-extremism,"Russia: Supreme Court bans 'LGBT movement' for 'extremism' Russia's authorities already take a draconian line against LGBT people, who face not only legal sanctions but violence and threats. Russia's Supreme Court on Thursday banned the ""international LGBT movement"" for extremism in the midst of the country's conservative turn, paving the way for legal action against any group defending LGBT+ rights in Russia. Judge Oleg Nefedov ordered that ""the international LGBT movement and its subsidiaries be recognised as extremist and their activities banned from the territory of the Russian Federation"", according to AFP correspondents on the ground. Mr Nefedov said that the ban would come into force ""immediately"". The hearing took place without defence counsel, as no organisation bearing the name ""international LGBT movement"" exists in Russia, and behind closed doors as the case was classified as ""secret"". In mid-November, the Russian Ministry of Justice called for the ""international LGBT movement"" to be described as an ""extremist organisation"" and banned, without clearly saying which organisation it was targeting. Any public activity associated with what Russia considers to be ""non-traditional"" sexual preferences could now be deemed ""extremism"", a crime punishable by heavy prison sentences. Until now, LGBT+ people risked heavy fines if they engaged in what the authorities called ""propaganda"", but not imprisonment. In recent years, Russian propagandists and politicians have increasingly referred to homosexuals as ""paedophiles"" and claimed they are part of an insidious attempt to ""westernise"" Russian society. The situation is particularly dire in the Caucasus republic of Chechnya, where gay men in particular face imprisonment, torture and murder at the hands of police. Many have escaped into exile.

Hamas has claimed responsibility for a gun attack in Jerusalem that killed three people and left eight others wounded. The Palestinian militant group called for an ""escalation of resistance against Israel."" Two brothers from East Jerusalem ""sacrificed themselves by carrying out an operation"" Hamas said in a statement. Israeli police confirmed the gunmen had been shot and killed. Authorities say the men were driving a car, one armed with an M-16 assault rifle and the other with a pistol, firing on the bus stop in West Jerusalem during rush hour. Footage broadcast by Israeli television showed two men getting out of a white car and opening fire before being shot dead. Israel's Shin Bet security agency identified the brothers as 30 and 38-year-old. Both were affiliated with Hamas and had previously been jailed in Israel. ""The operation came as a natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the occupation,"" Hamas said in a statement, citing Israel's military offensive in Gaza and the treatment of Palestinian prisoners. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who arrived in Tel Aviv on Wednesday evening, said the attack was a reminder of ""the terrorist threat that Israel faces on a daily basis."" In a statement, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated the two soldiers and the civilian who intervened at the scene of the attack. ""My government will continue to extend the distribution of weapons to citizens"", he said. In mid-November, an Israeli soldier was killed and five members of the Israeli security forces injured in an attack at a roadblock separating Jerusalem from the West Bank, a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. The attack was claimed by the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas. The three assailants were shot dead.

https://www.euronews.com/2023/11/30/teen-held-on-suspicion-of-plotting-german-christmas-market-attack,"Teen held on suspicion of plotting German Christmas market attack Officials say the 15-year-old wrote in a chat group about plans for an attack in Western Germany. A 15-year-old boy and his alleged accomplice have been arrested by German authorities, on suspicion of planning a militant Islamist state style attack on a Christmas market. The teenager was detained Tuesday in Burscheid, a town near Cologne, while the other teenager was arrested in the eastern German state of Brandenburg. Prosecutors in Duesseldorf said on Thursday that he and the other suspect are accused of agreeing to use fuel to blow up a small truck at the Christmas market in Leverkusen, a city in western Germany, at the beginning of December. The teenager claimed he had acquired gasoline for the plan, according to a statement from prosecutors. The two suspects allegedly planned to leave Germany together after the attack and join the Islamic State-Khorasan Province extremist group, an IS offshoot active in and around Afghanistan. Investigators did not find fuel stocks at the 15-year-old's home, prosecutors said. He is being investigated on suspicion of conspiring to commit murder and preparing a serious act of violence. Before the arrests, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency said that the threat situation in the country has escalated since Hamas’ 7 October attack in southern Israel. The agency pointed to the risk of radicalisation of lone assailants who use simple means to attack “soft targets”. It said that “the danger is real and higher than it has been for a long time”.

https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/11/29/eu-countries-need-to-curb-irregular-migration-to-prevent-far-right-surge-says-manfred-webe,"EU countries need to curb irregular migration to prevent far-right surge, says Manfred Weber The next elections to the European Parliament risk unleashing a far-right surge if governments are unable to prove they can manage migration, Manfred Weber has warned. ""People want to see results. And that means, practically speaking, we have to lower the number of irregular arrivals,"" the leader of the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) said on Wednesday morning. In the first ten months of 2023, the European Union saw nearly 331,000 irregular border crossings, with the Central Mediterranean route accounting for the vast majority of incidents.The figuresrepresent the highest level for that period since 2015. ""The reception centres in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are full. People see the pictures from Lampedusa. That's the reality on the ground,"" Weber went on. ""People want to have a state that is solving problems, that is managing things. And until now, we haven't done so."" ""Sixty per cent of those arriving from the Mediterranean route are not allowed to stay. They have to return. And they don't go back home,"" he added. ""On returns, the state is not functioning."" During a meeting with journalists attended by Euronews, Weber, whose group is the largest formation in the European Parliament, reflected on the recent results of the Dutch elections, which brought about the surprising victory of Geert Wilders and his far-right, anti-Islam PVV party after a campaign dominated by the cost-of-living crisis,the lack of affordable housingand an increase in asylum seekers. The outcome was interpreted as a harsh rebuke to the centrist parties that have dominated Dutch politics for more than a decade. Although it's still unclear if Wilders will be able to secure a governing majority and become prime minister, his strong showing has raised fears of a far-right surge in thenext European elections, scheduled to take place between 6 and 9 June. Opinion polls already show far-right parties enjoying a strong position in countries like France, Germany, Austria and the Flemish region of Belgium while in Portugal andRomania, they have begun an upward trend. Echoing those fears, Weber called on the European Parliament and member states to wrap up the New Pact on Migration and Asylum before Europeans go to the polls so that governments have something to show to sceptical voters. The New Pact is a comprehensive reform of the bloc's common policy that foresees a permanent system of ""mandatory solidarity"" to ensure the burden is effectively shared between the 27 countries. The overhaul, which comprises five different but interlinked pieces of legislation, is inthe final stretchof negotiations. ""We need a solution. If we fail to have a solution on the migration pact, we are risking ending up in a very difficult for the European Union as a whole,"" Weber said. ""If we go too far, from a left-wing perspective, then we risk breaking up the deal on the Council side,"" he added, referring to the breakthrough agreement that member states struck in the spring after a day ofmarathon talks in Luxembourg. ""I see politicians who neglect the problem, who don't see what is happening on the ground."" The external dimension Weber's hardened position on migration has been criticised by the Socialists and Green groups as an attempt to pacify the far-right and mimic its radical agenda under a veneer of centrism. Several parties that belong to the EPP have in recent years enteredcoalition agreementswith far-right formations in order to reach power. In Italy, the EPP-affiliated Forza Italia is one of the three parties that props up the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, which has been described as the most hard-right executive in the country's history. Earlier this month, Meloni signed a protocol with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama to outsource the processing of up to 36,000 asylum applications per year to the Balkan country.The deal is unprecedentedand has raised serious questions about the extraterritorial application of EU law and potential human rights violations. Meloni has defended the protocol as a natural development of the EU's renewed focus on the ""external dimension"" of migration, a catch-all term to promote closer cooperation with countries of transit and origin with the ultimate goal of preventing irregular arrivals. The strong attention to the ""external dimension"" has caused friction between conservatives and progressives in the European Parliament, with the former energetically supporting the approach and the latter urging caution and solidarity. ""We have to invest in these talks and we have to start these talks from a perspective of listening, not lecturing,"" Weber said, name-checking Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt as viable partners. So far, the only EU-wide result from the ""external dimension"" has been thememorandum of understandingwith Tunisia, which earmarks more than €700 million in EU funds across five thematic pillars, including financial assistance and border management. (Tunisia is the main gateway for migrants seeking to reach Italian shores.) Since its signature in July, the memorandum has attracted intense scrutiny from lawmakers, media and humanitarian NGOs due to Tunisia's dire record on human rights and the racist rhetoric of its president, Kais Saied. The memorandum was plunged into uncertainty in October after President Saiedordered the refundof €60 million in budget support, having dismissed the money as ""charity."" The European Commission insists work is ongoing to implement the five thematic pillars but no further disbursements have been announced. Weber, however, seemed optimistic and said that, if the bloc delivers on the investment promises made to Tunisia, the country will in turn ""help us fight against smugglers."" ""I know things are not easy but we now have an opportunity to work together with our neighbours,"" Weber told journalists. ""The agreement with Tunisia is the most urgent thing.""

https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/11/29/rise-in-hate-speech-on-social-media-platforms-new-eu-report-finds,"Hate speech on social media platforms rising, new EU report finds The study discovered that women, people of African descent, Jewish and Roma people were the most targeted. The European Union's Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) on Wednesday declared there has been a rise in hate speech on the internet in recent weeks following anewly- released reporton online content moderation. According to FRA, recent updates to EU laws and policies, designed to effectively regulate online content including hate speech, haven't been implemented fast enough and challenges surrounding the protection of human rights online remain. The body analysed 1,500 posts on social media in Bulgaria, Germany, Italy and  Sweden and discovered that women were the main target of hate posts as well as people with African, Roma and Jewish heritage. The agency surveyed posts on the social network X, Telegram, YouTube and Reddit.  Analysts did not have access to data on Facebook or Instagram, both owned by Meta Platforms. The study collected social media posts over six months, using specific keywords that could indicate potential online hate against these target groups. FRA concluded that scrutiny and moderation are essential to identify hate speech against women, migrants or religious beliefs that proliferate on the internet. The report also called for greater transparency by the relevant authorities. Of the 1,500 posts analysed, more than half were categorised as direct harassment. Hate messages have been on the rise in recent weeks, especially in pro or anti-Semitic publications following the Hamas militant group's attack in southern Israel on 7 October and  Israel's subsequent ground offensive. X under increased scrutiny The FRA report also follows recent claims that the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, is spreading misinformation and hate speech after advertisers fled the site over concerns their ads were showing up next to pro-Nazi content. IBM, NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast said that they stopped advertising on X after the liberal advocacy group Media Matters said their ads were appearing alongside material praising Nazis. X has since filed a lawsuit, claiming that Media Matters manipulated algorithms on the platform and said the Washington-based nonprofit made the claims to ""drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp"". X owner, billionaire Elon Musk, is also in hot water after he commented on an account holder's post that was accusing Jews of hating white people and professing indifference to antisemitism. He tweeted: ""You have said the actual truth"". He has since faced criticism from the White House and the European Commission. Musk, who has described himself as a free-speech absolutist, tweeted during his Israel visit on Monday that ""actions speak louder than words"". Meanwhile, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has also saidshe is quitting X, claiming the network has become a ""gigantic global sewer"" that is toxic for democracy and constructive debate. ""I refuse to endorse this evil scheme,"" she wrote. ""With its thousands of anonymous accounts and its troll farms, life on Twitter is the exact opposite of democratic life,"" Hidalgo said in a long post titled, ""Why I am leaving Twitter"". Hidalgo's office said tweets on Monday in French and English that announced her departure from X would be the Socialist mayor's last and that she would then close her account - which has 1.5 million followers - at the end of the week. Musk has faced accusations of tolerating antisemitic messages on the platform since purchasing it last year.

https://www.euronews.com/2023/11/29/how-many-times-can-we-say-never-again-again,"Euroviews.How many times can we say 'never again' again? A comparison of our responses to recent conflicts should not suggest that there is a hierarchy of victims. Quite the contrary, the history of the EU has shown repeatedly that human rights protections benefit us all — they are not a zero-sum game, Holger Loewendorf writes. The people of Sudan must be wondering what else needs to happen before Europe pays attention to their plight once more. Earlier this month, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and affiliated Arab militias attacked the town of Ardamata in West Darfur. The UN Refugee Agency reported that more than 800 people were killed, while 8,000 others — likely an undercount — fled to neighbouring Chad over the course of three days. After seizing the local military base, the RSF and their allies targeted members of the non-Arab Masalit community inside their homes — shooting men and boys, sexually assaulting women and girls, and setting fires to shelters housing displaced people. These atrocities may amount to the single largest mass killing since civil war erupted in April and raise the spectre of yet another genocide, following a wave of large-scale violence in June. Are we leaving Sudan by the wayside? The United Nations, the European Union, and other Western governments have condemned the systematic killing and displacement of the Masalit from their land since the start of Sudan’s civil war, but their criticism has not deterred the RSF from committing more atrocities. Just as striking is the absence of public and media engagement on this issue, especially when compared to the intense news coverage and mass rallies (with increasingly disturbing antisemitic messages) after Hamas' militant wing launched a terror attack on Israel on 7 October of this year, killing more than 1,200 people. We saw a similarly passionate response across civil society when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, so what explains the apparent indifference towards the victims in West Darfur? Do we care less because this is happening in Africa, where news of conflict, famine, and poverty confirm our preconceived notions of what this continent looks like? But we should recall that our biases and feelings are not facts. If there was nothing but a vicious cycle of despair, why are we participating in a process that some observers have paternalistically called a “new scramble for Africa”? European delegations are touring the continent in search of allies, influence, and economic opportunities, in large part because our electronic devices rely on raw materials that cannot be sourced domestically. Our competitors in this race are the United States, China, Russia and others. Our motives — and theirs — are seldom pure, but if Europe wants to stand out as a reliable and trustworthy partner to African nations, it cannot engage selectively and leave Sudan by the wayside. Our inaction makes others risk their lives several times over Alternatively, are we paying less attention because rocket attacks in the Middle East and Ukraine are physically closer to us than the bullets being fired in Darfur? Do we believe that war crimes happening 4,500 km southeast of Brussels will not affect our lives? If so, consider that according to the International Organization for Migration, the Sudanese civil war displaced more than 4,8 million individuals since mid-April. An additional 1,3 million people fled into neighbouring countries, more than half a million of them to Chad alone. At least 31% of the displaced population is younger than 18 years, and close to 90% of them do not have access to education. An entire generation cannot take advantage of the same opportunities that most Europeans can take for granted. These young people have the potential to rebuild Sudan, but they require peace and stability to do so. Instead, our inaction will drive many of them to risk their lives several times over in search of a better future, which may await across the Mediterranean Sea. If EU member states prefer that they stay in Africa, perhaps a more active role in the prevention of these massacres, to say nothing of genocide, is required. Otherwise, we have already seen that politicians throughout Europe will cynically exploit their arrival and our failure to accommodate them. They are increasingly winning elections by demonising refugees and migrants wholesale. Meanwhile, we have the means along with historical, moral, and legal obligations – to say nothing of the demographic need – to provide safety and a sense of hope for them. If everything is a crisis, nothing is a crisis Lastly, is our attention span overtaxed by the conflagration of events that is frequently summarized as “polycrisis”? In the last three years, we have had to cope with a global pandemic, accelerating climate change as well as an energy and cost-of-living crisis — the latter two caused by the aforementioned war in Ukraine. Narrowing the scope to the last month, one can add military conflicts in Israel and Gaza, Nagorno-Karabakh, and the Sahel zone (including Sudan) to the list. So yes, it is difficult to keep track of every single calamity, and our selective perception of bad news may even help us remain sane. But it is also worth noting that the term “polycrisis”, while appealing in its descriptive function, is analytically quite limiting. It flattens discrete, though frequently connected moments into an amorphous whole that can create the impression of a self-fulfilling prophecy. If everything is a crisis, nothing is, so there is nothing I can or need to do about it. The consequence of this doom spiral is a retreat from public affairs and ultimately the surrender of universal values. The European Union and most of its member states have so far resisted this temptation. Instead, the response to current geopolitical challenges has been a desire to “be among the keepers of international and humanitarian law,” as Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, recently put it. 'We see you, we can help, and we will' Sudan is a test of the European commitment to human rights. We have failed the country before and revealed that our high-minded principles are worthless unless accompanied by actions. The gap between rhetoric and reality is widening as long as EU leaders are not taking meaningful action in good faith to address this crisis as well. A comparison between our responses to the invasion of Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas on the one hand, and the terror in Darfur on the other, should not suggest that there is a hierarchy of victims. Quite the contrary, the history of the European Union has shown repeatedly that human rights protections benefit us all — they are not a zero-sum game. Now it is high time to issue a credible promise to the Sudanese people: we see you, we can help, and we will. _Holger Loewendorf serves as Senior Advisor at the European Foundation for Democracy (EFD), a Brussels-based policy centre._ At Euronews, we believe all views matter.

https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/11/28/migrant-smugglers-could-face-up-to-15-years-in-prison-under-proposed-new-eu-rules,"Migrant smugglers could face up to 15 years in prison under proposed new EU rules The European Commission is seeking to toughen penalties for human traffickers as the bloc struggles to bring down the number of migrants lured in by networks of smugglers. In the first ten months of 2023, the European Unionsawnearly 331,000 irregular border crossings, with the Central Mediterranean route accounting for the vast majority of incidents. The figures represent the highest level for that period since 2015 and have led to calls from member states to harden the common migration policy. As part of its response, the European Commission unveiled on Tuesday two draft laws that toughen the punishment for the crime of human trafficking and expand the role of Europol, the bloc's law enforcement agency. Under a new directive that updates the 2002 framework, the EU's executive proposes a wider definition of the smuggling offense, which now includes advertising on websites and social media designed to entice people to come to Europe. The definition also covers instances where there is a ""high likelihood"" of causing harm to an asylum seeker, even if this is done without obtaining any financial profit. The directive introduces a series of aggravating circumstances, such as the use of violence and the trafficking of unaccompanied minors, that prolong imprisonment for those found guilty of smuggling. Causing the death of a migrant could lead to a maximum of 15 years in prison – up from 8 years foreseen in the current legislation. State actors, however, will be excluded from penalties, even if they are sometimes behind irregular migration, as was the case during the 2021 border crisis orchestrated by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Most recently, Finlandhas accusedRussia of instigating a surge in migration flows. Humanitarian organisations that conduct search-and-rescue operations, which Italyhas blamedfor acting as a ""pull factor"" but Germany defends as carrying out a moral duty, will be protected from criminal charges. Another novelty lies in the principle of jurisdiction, which the directive extends to crimes committed in international waters. Incidents involving migrant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea regularly take place in high waters, like this year's shipwreck near Messenia, Greece, that left more than 500 people presumed dead. This opens a legal void when it comes to determining the country entitled to prosecution. ""We need a little bit of a paradigm shift,"" Ylva Johansson, the European Commissioner for home affairs, said on Tuesday. ""Not only going after the street-level perpetrators but also going after the high-level targets and going after the criminal networks themselves."" Every year, smugglers reap between €5 and €6 billion in global profits, she noted, ""money that comes from desperate people and from blackmailed families."" Johansson said that 90% of the irregular border crossings seen this year had been ""facilitated"" by smugglers' networks, which ""very often"" have an organised criminal group behind them. The Commissioner warned that traffickers are becoming ""increasingly sophisticated, increasingly professional and increasingly international,"" as well as increasingly violent against migrants and border guards. ""Criminal groups are posing a threat to us, our society, which is comparable to a terrorist threat,"" she said. In addition to the directive, the Commission unveiled a draft regulation that will enable Europol to deploy its forces and experts inside non-EU countries, provided a working agreement is signed with the host nation. The presentation of the two draft laws coincided with the launching in Brussels of the ""Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling,"" which gathered representatives from 57 countries. The alliance is a ""call to action"" to move away from the nation-based perspective and turn the fight against migrant smuggling into a truly international endeavour, Johansson said. ""These actions,"" she said, ""allow us to keep our focus where it should be: punishing the smugglers – never punishing the migrants."" The two pieces of legislation presented on Tuesday still need to undergo negotiations between the European Parliament and member states. Due to the timing of the announcement, talks are not expected to conclude in this mandate and will have to wait until after the June elections to reach the finish line.

https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/11/28/emissions-are-still-rising-when-will-they-start-to-fall,"Climate Now Live Debate: Emissions are still rising, when will they start to fall? For our latest Climate Now Debate, broadcast live from COP28, we'll be discussing whether an emissions peak is in sight for greenhouse gases. Despite repeated warnings from climate scientists, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are still rising. From wildfires in Europe to floods in Pakistan, the reverberations of our failure to reduce emissions are being felt on a global scale. The IPCC says emissions must peak before 2025 if we are to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement, but time is rapidly running out. Our expert panel of climate scientists and policymakers will be debating why GHGs are still risinglive from COP28 in Dubaion December 5 at 10.00 am CET (1 pm UAE Time). You can watch the debate in this article or on Euronews' YouTube Channel. While there has been some progress - since the agreement was signed in 2015, predicted GHG emissions in 2030 have fallen by 13 per cent - drastic cuts still need to take place if warming is to be limited. In fact, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) states in itsEmissions Gap 2023 Report, that projected emissions need to fall by a further 28 per cent by 2030 to stay within the Paris Agreement 2°C pathway. To have any hope of meeting the 1.5°C pathway target, they need to fall by a huge 42 per cent. With GHGs rising by 1.2 per cent between 2021 and 2022, and with emissions reaching a record high of 57.4 Gigatonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (GtCO2e) in the same year, according to the UNEP, is there any hope of emissions peaking in time? To find out the answers to these questions and more tune in to the debate. The live event also ties in with the release of the latestClimate Action Tracker report, which we will be discussing with our guests. Our panellists are: Bertrand Piccard, Chairman, Solar Impulse Foundation Both psychiatrist and explorer, Bertrand Piccard made history by achieving two aeronautical firsts: a non-stop round-the-world balloon flight and a solar-powered round-the-world flight. A pioneer in considering ecology from the angle of economic profitability, he has been promoting renewable energies and clean technologies since the early 2000s. With the Solar Impulse Foundation, which he chairs, he is demonstrating that it is possible to meet ecological challenges without undermining economic development. In April 2021, he achieved his first goal of identifying and labelling 1000 ""Efficient Solutions"". A humanist, this former United Nations ambassador for the environment, puts his reputation at the service of progress, sustainability and quality of life, three themes reflected in his concept of ""qualitative economy"". To support his approach, he strives to bring together the forces at work, raise public awareness and encourage political action through advocacy for modernization of the legislative framework and guides to accelerate the adoption of clean technologies and accompany political and industrial decision-makers in their ecological transition. **Oksana Tarasova,**Senior Scientific Officer in Infrastructure Department Mia Moisio, Climate Action Tracker Mia Moisio's work centers on the global efforts to reduce temperature increase to 1.5°C, with a particular focus on climate policy in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.

She holds a Master’s degree in Energy Policy and a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and Middle Eastern studies from Sciences Po Paris. Mia’s working languages are English, French, Finnish and Spanish. Moderator, Jeremy Wilks, Euronews Why are emissions still rising and what does this mean for the atmosphere? Despite repeated warnings of the consequences, along with an increase in extreme weather events, GHG emissions continue to rise. While EU countries such asSpainhave committed to phasing out coal mines by 2030, and the US closed down 13.5 gigawatts of coal-powered energy capacity in 2022, there was still a 1 per cent rise in coal capacity in 2022. This was due to 44.5 GW of commissioned capacity opening in China. The cost of war is also taking its toll, with the Ukraine government estimating that by  October 2022, theUkraine war had released 31 million tonnes of CO2into the atmosphere. This continued rise is having real-world impacts, and according to the Emissions Gap Report, from the start of 2023 until the beginning of October, there were 86 days with temperatures over 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. While data collected byThe Copernicus Climate Change Serviceand the ERA5 dataset, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) shows that 17 November 2023 was the first day that global temperatures exceeded 2°C above pre-industrial levels. With so much at stake, COP28 will bring us the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake, a mechanism that will take a long, hard look at global attempts to meet the targets enshrined in the Paris Agreement. Our panel will be discussing the likely results of the Global Stocktake and what this will mean for the future of the Paris Agreement on December 5. What is the Global Stocktake and will it hold polluters to account? Set to conclude atCOP28this year, the first Global Stocktake will analyse attempts to mitigate GHG emissions since theParis Agreement 2015, while also looking at any progress towards adaptation. While the Stocktake won't name and shame any individual countries, given the severity of the UN's Emissions Gap Report, it is unlikely to heap praise on international efforts thus far. Further stocktakes will take place every five years, with the next one due in 2028. The UN hopes the stocktake will give governments a chance to accelerate their efforts in time for the next round of climate action plans, which are due in 2025. What else is being done to reduce emissions? While emissions need to peak before 2025 to stay below 1.5°C warming, unless drastic cuts are made now, this is looking increasingly unlikely. Beyond theGlobal Stocktake, there are a number of other bodies that are trying to hold governments to account. The Climate Action Tracker (CAT) will release its latest report on December 5, to tie in with COP28's 'Climate Law and Governance Day'. An independent scientific project, it tracks government climate action, measuring it against the Paris Agreement's aim of ""holding warming well below 2°C"". A collaboration between Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute, the CAT has been providing independent analysis to policymakers since 2009. Alongside pressure from CAT, the EU is hoping to limit ""carbon leakage"" - which happens when companies based in the EU move carbon-intensive production to non-EU countries with less stringent climate policies. TheEU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)aims to put a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods entering the bloc, both to encourage cleaner production and ensure its climate objectives aren't undermined. TheEU's Methane Strategyis also set to be formally adopted in December, while theSolar Impulse Foundationhas devised 1,000 solutions that they hope will address environmental challenges without compromising economic growth. Will these projects be enough to bring about the rapid mitigation needed? And are peak emissions in sight?

https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/11/28/why-the-eu-is-so-worried-about-chinas-anti-espionage-law,"Why the EU is so worried about China's anti-espionage law For the past half year, high-ranking officials of the European Union have raised the alarm about China's anti-espionage law. Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission's executive vice president in charge of trade relations, described the legislation during his trip to China in late September as a ""great concern to our business community"" whose ""ambiguity allows too much room for interpretation"" and ""significantly decreases"" investors' confidence. ""This is exactly what I mean by a lose-lose outcome,""Dombrovskis said. What exactly makes the law so troubling for Europeans? Introduced for the first time in 2014, the bill is intended to ""prevent, frustrate and punish"" acts of espionage. Its provisions grant the country's central authorities a broad mandate to crack down on activities that are perceived to be a threat against the ""national security, honour and interests"". The law added to the intricate machinery the Chinese Communist Party has at its disposal to exert control over citizens, companies and organisations. This control has deepened under the rule of President Xi Jinping, who has remodelled the relation between state and party to centralise power in his persona. Xi's pursuit for supreme authority has triggered a fraught standoff with Western countries. The Chinese leader has accused G7 allies, particularly the United States, of trying to derail the country's ambition to become a global leader in technology and innovation. Meanwhile, liberal democracies believe Xi is attempting to dismantle the rules-based order established at the end of World War II and impose an alternative system made in China's image and likeness. Under this atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust, the Communist Party has unveiled a string of legal and policy instruments to make sure all aspects of Chinese society, even those taking place abroad, are under an omnipresent oversight of sorts. This push led to the revision of theanti-espionage law, which came into effect on 1 July. The text's main novelty lies in Article 4, which provides a list of acts of espionage that can be repressed. The amended article vastly expands potential crimes beyond the traditional definition of espionage – that is, intelligence apparatuses and their network of agents – and now includes activities ""carried out, instigated or funded"" by people and entities ""other than espionage organisations and their representatives."" In addition to state secrets, Article 4 covers the illegal collection of ""other documents, data, materials or items related to national security"" and the execution of cyberattacks, intrusions and disruptions against state property and critical infrastructure. In its final paragraph, it simply lists ""other espionage activities"" as a conduct that can be criminally prosecuted, without providing further explanation. The elastic definition of espionage is followed by several articles that shore up the authority of investigators, who are entitled, among other things, to inspect electronic equipment, raid facilities, seize documents, collect data, freeze property and arrest individuals – all of which can be filmed. Foreigners who are charged with spying can be swiftly deported and forbidden from entering Chinese territory for up to 10 years. Moreover, the legislation encourages vigilantism as it calls on ""all citizens and organisations"" to ""support and assist"" the central authorities and ""promptly report"" suspicious behaviour. Those who do might be given ""commendations and awards."" Running a tight ship For the EU, the revised provisions of the anti-espionage law are both alarmingly vast and dangerously vague, giving the state a remarkably broad margin of discretion to decide what constitutes a threat to China's integrity. Notably, at no point does the text provide a clear definition of ""national security, honour and interests,"" making the room for interpretation even larger. Actions that were once thought to be harmless can now, in theory, be deemed injurious. The uncertainty has been compounded by Beijing's silence about the revised law's actual purposes, says Vincent Brussee, a researcher of contemporary China at the University of Leiden, in the Netherlands. ""The concept of national security in China has immensely broadened over the past few decades. It has always been relatively broad. But Xi Jinping has introduced a concept that's called the 'comprehensive' outlook on national security, which essentially means that national security covers all domains of society,"" Brussee told Euronews. ""Xi Jinping sees national security as the bedrock of national development."" One of the defining traits of Xi's rule has been his zeal to tell China's story on his own terms to domestic and global audiences. His diplomatic envoys, sometimes referred to as ""Wolf Warriors,"" are quick toharshly denouncecritics who challenge the official line. This firm grip on China's narrative has driven a global propaganda machine and can help explain the latest amendments to the anti-espionage law. ""China is very keen to make sure that some foreign actors, especially the United States, do not get all of that information that could counteract or contradict whatever the Chinese Communist Party is trying to say,"" Brussee said. ""The anti-espionage law looks like a tool to restrict the number of sources that people can draw from, or at least penalise people who manage to constantly find new creative angles to draw on new sensitive forms of information."" Shadow of prosecution So who is at risk? What information can be considered a threat? According to alegal analysisby De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek, a Dutch law firm, the revised law increases scrutiny over companies that handle trade secrets, research and development (R&D) and data related to medicine, geology, demography and other fields of strategic importance. This means information about high-tech, like semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence, and the military may also become a liability. The law firm advises multinationals that operate in China to ""critically re-examine"" all their operations that involve the collection and processing of data and to ""carefully assess"" if any of their regular suppliers across the country have state affiliations. Special attention should be put on internal audits and investigations, when ""extra caution may be needed if overseas transfer of data is involved."" This could prove problematic for European subsidiaries, which are compelled to uphold adequate due diligence and send regular reports to their headquarters. Underan upcoming EU directiveon corporate sustainability, big-sized firms will be required to tackle the ""adverse impacts"" of their operations, such as pollution, biodiversity loss, child labour and worker exploitation. Those who fail to comply with the directive, which is still not final, will face fines while victims will be empowered to launch legal action. Aseparate EU law, also in negotiations, seeks to ban imports of products made using forced labour. Last year, a United Nations report found that forced labour, sexual violence and degrading treatment had taken place against Uyghur, Kazakh and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region, an accusation that Beijing vigorously denied. The new rules mean that European companies will need to obtain highly detailed and, at times, sensitive information directly from their Chinese providers. The anti-espionage law could turn this already-onerous bureaucratic exercise into a high-risk gamble, with the shadow of criminal prosecution looming large over auditors and consultants. A series of police interventions against American companies that occurred earlier this year before the revised law came into force, including a raid in March on the Mintz Group, a corporate due diligence firm, that laterresultedin a $1.5 million (€1.4 million) fine for ""unapproved statistical work,"" suggests Europe's private sector will have to keep extra tabs and err on the side of caution, even if doing do scales down the scope of their work. ""If companies are not able to comply with these EU requirements, which could potentially entail civil and criminal liability, they will be ultimately forced to leave the market or at least reduce operations in China,"" a spokesperson of BusinessEurope, a leading industry association, said in an emailed statement. ""China's anti-espionage law can potentially conflict with the two pieces of EU legislation, leaving economic operators between a rock and a hard place.""

https://www.euronews.com/2023/11/28/romania-is-facing-crucial-elections-in-2024-will-the-country-put-the-rising-far-right-in-p,"Romania is facing crucial elections in 2024 - will the country put the rising far-right in power Romania’s far-right party AUR is growing in popularity and could enter a government coalition next year after the country’s parliamentary election. Romania, a member of the European Union, will hold local, presidential, parliamentary and European elections next year - making 2024 a crucial time for the country and for Europe, as the far-right is expected to continue gaining ground. “These elections are important for the political situation in Romania as well as for the entire European Union, where the far-right has risen in popularity in many member states like Sweden, Slovakia and now the Netherlands,” Fernando Casal Bertoa, an associate professor in Comparative Politics at the University of Nottingham, told Euronews. The elections next year might determine “a completely new direction for the country,” he added. A recent survey by pollster INSCOP released in early November showed that the country’s ruling coalition government - which includes the leftist Social Democrats (PSD) and centre-right Liberals (PNL) - would fall short of an outright majority in the parliamentary election next year. The coalition government has been struggling this year with keeping the country’s public finances in check - a situation which has paved the way for the far right to gain ground in Romania. According to the opinion poll - which was commissioned by Romanian news website News.ro and conducted among a sample of 1,100 people between 23 October and 2 November - 29.5% of Romanians would vote for Prime MinisterMarcel Ciolacu’s PSD and 18.4% for the Liberals in the parliamentary elections next year. According to the INSCOP poll, the ultra-nationalist opposition party Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, AUR - an abbreviation for “gold” in Romanian - would have 20.2% of voters’ support - putting the party ahead of the Liberals. What is AUR, and what does it stand for? In December 2020, the little-known AUR, which had been formed in the autumn of the previous year, rose from obscurity to take almost 9% of the overall vote in Romania’s parliamentary elections. Since then, the party has been steadily gaining more support in recent opinion surveys. The rise of the party was due in part to the overwhelming support of the Romanian diaspora, which, according to Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, a professor of Comparative Public Policy at the LUISS Guido Carli University in Rome, “has a large percentage of low-skilled, marginal people who in fact only work seasonally in Europe.” “I called them, much to the indignation of some people, a ‘lumpen-diaspora’, to paraphrase Karl Marx,” Mungiu-Pippidi explained, referring to a term which in Marxist contexts indicates a population uninterested in revolutionary advancement. “They needed a radical ‘F… you’ alternative to the existing political system and they found it” in AUR, she added. The pandemic also “tremendously helped” the rise of AUR, the same way it helped Alternative for Germany (AfD) grow its base, Mungiu-Pippidi said. “They were the anti-vaccine party, and in Romania - also with the complicity of the Orthodox church - half the population did not get a vaccine. This was the main wind in their sails,” she added. “Same as in the Netherlands, people are really unhappy with the way the country is being governed,” Claudiu Tufis, associate professor of political science, University of Bucharest, told Euronews explaining the popularity of the far-right party. “There isn’t a lot of representation in the Romanian political system, with pretty much the same coalition uninterruptedly leading the country for almost 10 years now. They are looking for someone who speaks their own language,” he added. AUR declares to be standing for “family, nation, faith, and freedom,” but Mungiu-Pippidi told Euronews that it actually stands for “anti-science, Christian fundamentalism and sovereignism.” The party has also positioned itself as an anti-corruption party at a time when the country was facing significant corruption scandals - a move that has been embraced by other populist parties in Europe, like Italy’s Five Star Movement. AUR is also known to oppose same-sex marriage and has called for the Republic of Moldova's unification with Romania. In 2018, AUR founder - former journalist Claudiu Tarziu - called for a referendum that attempted to ban same-sex marriage, which failed. Could AUR be part of a new coalition government? According to Casal Bertoa, whether AUR would one day become part of a coalition government with the PSD would depend on the results of the election. “The Liberals might want to govern with the far-right party but not under them - so they might bring them if they have a bigger backing than AUR, but not vice versa. It’s difficult to predict,” he continued. “But anything is possible,” he added. “We have seen a trend in Europe to normalise the far right and the far left, and the elections in the Netherlands are a clear example of that.” “I expected AUR to win a little bit more than they did in the last round of elections,” Tufis said. “But they probably will be in a position that won’t allow it to form a coalition, the political parties are arguing that AUR should be kept at a distance,” he continued. “It’s probably more likely that the Social Democrats and the Liberals will continue with the same coalition they had for the past 10 years.” With the level of support currently estimated in polls, AUR could claim between 8 and 11 MEPs after the EU elections in June 2024. The party is then likely to ally with Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, which AUR president George Simion said is “a political model for us.” Is the EU keeping an eye on Romania? Casal Bertoa thinks that the EU is looking closely at what’s happening in Romania, as well as other countries like Spain and the Netherlands, “and the great thing is that the EU has mechanisms to intervene if these far-right parties threaten democracy or the rule of law.” The problem, he added, is that “it has no way to stop the rise of the far right.” Tufis agrees, saying that even if AUR wins big in the European election, “they will be controlled within the European Parliament.” Mungiu-Pippidi thinks the EU has no reason to worry about AUR. “Romania is well controlled by a left-right coalition solidly supported by its much too powerful secret services and military establishment,” she said. “The church may flirt with AUR, but it always stands with the power establishment. AUR would get co-opted, like all radicals before them, with governmental perks, though until then they may provide some colourful moments in the European Parliament,” she added.

https://www.euronews.com/2023/11/24/protesters-denounce-blockage-of-eu-legislation-defining-rape-as-sex-without-consent,"Protesters denounce blockage of EU legislation defining rape as sex without consent Around a hundred women demonstrated in Brussels on Friday to denounce gender violence on the eve of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on 25 November. The women wore red gloves and held up banners with QR codes, which hid ""intimate"" messages from the women who carried them. The project was spearheaded by the renowned Spanish artist Alicia Framis. ""I wanted to demonstrate in keeping with the feminine, which is silence, retrospection, elegance [...] think that the main issue for women throughout Europe is violence, but not only physical violence but also verbal violence,"" the artist explained. Framis organised the ""Secret Strike"" in collaboration with the Spanish Embassy in Brussels. This 'performance' brought together a group of volunteers who for ten minutes remained motionless to denounce the physical and sexual violence that affects one in three women in the world, according to the United Nations. And it took place as European equality ministers held an informal meeting this Friday in Pamplona, Spain. The informal talks between EU member states were meant to push through the first European directive against violence against women. Framis said that they decided to organise this ""Secret Strike"" in front of the European Council building to denounce the blockage of legislation that would define rape as sex without consent in the bloc’s 27 countries The artist warned that ""instead of making progress, many countries are thinking of cutting back"" on women's rights. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, proposed legislation last year to make consent-based rape laws consistent across the bloc, and to introduce a common set of penalties. While other details of the directive, which include a proposal for the criminalisation of female genital mutilation and cyberbullying, seem to gather a consensus among the 27 member countries, the definition of rape based on the lack of consent is deeply divisive. According to Human Rights Watch, only 13 EU member states use consent-based definitions to criminalise rape. Many others still require the use of force, or threat, to carry out punishment. France, for instance, considers that rape can be considered to have occurred when “an act of sexual penetration or an oral-genital act is committed on a person, with violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” Negotiations between the European Parliament, member states and the European Commission are at a standstill due to the reluctance of some countries in the EU to include the crime of rape in the final text, such as France and Germany.

https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/11/24/people-with-autism-have-a-lower-life-expectancy-than-the-uk-average-new-study-reveals,"People with autism have a lower life expectancy than the UK average, new study reveals Experts say the new estimates are “not surprising” but lifespans of people with autism are not as low as previously thought. People diagnosed with autism and a learning disability were more likely to die prematurely in the United Kingdom compared to those without those conditions, according to a new study. Published in The Lancet Regional Health – Europe journal, the study is the first to estimate the life expectancy of autistic people in the UK, with researchers saying it reveals an urgent need to address inequalities to prevent premature death for people on the autism spectrum. “Autism itself does not, to our knowledge, directly reduce life expectancy, but we know that autistic people experience health inequalities, meaning that they often don’t get the support and help that they need when they need it,” Josh Stott, the lead investigator and a professor of ageing and clinical psychology at University College London (UCL), said in a statement. “We wanted to explore whether this impacted the average life expectancy for diagnosed autistic people living in the UK”. The researchers studied anonymised data from 1989 to 2019 of 17,130 people diagnosed as autistic without a learning disability and 6,450 people diagnosed as autistic with a learning disability. They found that autistic men and women without a learning disability had an average life expectancy of 74.6 and 76.8 years respectively. Autistic people with a learning disability had an even lower life expectancy of 71.7 years for men and 69.6 years for women. While this was lower than the average life expectancy in the UK of around 80 for men and 83 for women, it was higher than previous estimates, researchers said, adding that there was a need to examine why some autistic people die prematurely. The World Health Organization (WHO)estimatesthat around 1 in 100 children has autism, which covers a diverse group of conditions characterised by some difficulty with social interaction and communication. An estimated five million people in the EU are on the autism spectrum as well, but many autistic adults over the age of 50 are not diagnosed. ‘Results do not come as a surprise’ For Aurélie Baranger, the director of the Brussels-based charity Autism Europe, which coordinates 90 autism organisations across the continent, the findings of the study come as no surprise but rather align with other European and US studies. She named a few reasons that this might be the case, including problems with access to healthcare, misdiagnosis, and other co-occurring conditions or mental health issues among autistic people. “Autism is a condition where there you have difficulties with social communication and social interaction, and it means that…services in general are not accessible in terms of communication,” Baranger told Euronews Next. Autistic people may also have different ways to express pain that could lead to misdiagnosis or could “attribute their behaviour to their disability instead of another medical condition” such as epilepsy, Baranger added. While some people with autism spectrum disorders can live independently, others will need long-term care and support. People on the autism spectrum are also more likely to have mental health issues, with suicide rates higher in this population. “It’s linked to many aspects of their lives, their rights not being respected, being discriminated throughout their lives. There are many factors: the stress of not being understood and living in a world that doesn't accommodate the needs of autistic people,” Baranger said. Underdiagnosis of autism spectrum disorders A previous studycarried out by UCL researchersnoted that the number of autistic people in the UK may be twice as high as previously thought. Stott said that the reduction in life expectancy may thus be overestimated as it only looks at a fraction of the autistic population. Dr Judith Brown, the UK National Autistic Society’s head of evidence and research said in a statement that while the results suggest a smaller difference “between the life expectancy of autistic and non-autistic people, they are still significant”. “These findings demonstrate that autistic people continue to face unacceptable inequalities through a lack of understanding, barriers to vital services, and inadequate care, which lead to poorer mental and physical health outcomes,” she said in a statement. The European Parliament recently passed anon-binding resolutionon harmonising the rights of autistic people across EU countries which covers access to healthcare, employment, and education. “This resolution is non-binding, but it’s a strong call for action both at the European level and at the national level, for policymakers to take further action to address the discrimination and adapt for autistic people,” Baranger said. Ahead of the European elections, Autism Europe is also following the European Commission’s implementation of its strategy on the rights of persons with disabilities. The organisation has called for a public health plan for autism that includes accommodation in healthcare premises for autistic people as well as relevant training for health workers. In September, the EU executive proposed aEuropean Disability Cardto serve as proof of disability status in the bloc. While subject to negotiations, the card could be “beneficial for the autism community,” Baranger added.

https://www.euronews.com/business/2023/11/23/where-in-europe-can-you-earn-the-most-for-the-same-job,"Where in Europe can you earn the most for the same job? How do net salaries compare across Europe for some of the most sought-after positions? Euronews Business takes a closer look at what to expect if you relocate. Migrating for a better future often comes with a huge headache: finding out where the best offers are, such as who gives the best salaries, what the cost of living is like, and so on. In 2021, half of the 3.7 million people who moved to the EU did so for financial and family reasons, both from within and outside the bloc. When researching where is best to move, gross salary figures for job offers can often be misleading (unless you're a fearless accountant with a knack for working out tax), especially if the destination is somewhere like Denmark where workers face one of the highest tax burdens in the EU. According to Eurostat, the average annual wages (for a single person) ranged from €81,818 in Switzerland down to €15,335 in Greece in 2022. To see how your take-home pay can vary significantly based on where you might choose to live, we analysed the competitiveness of salaries for five popular jobs in the Eurozone countries, UK, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, and Iceland. How we worked it out Due to the complexity and variety of the tax systems across Europe, we are focusing on the average single worker and examining the final figure when the average personal income tax and social security contributions are taken off the gross salary. The all-in rate, which includes these two deductions, is based on 2022 data provided by the OECD. If you decide to crunch the numbers yourself, you will find two types of income tax rates: the effective and the marginal tax rate. The latter is often more than 40% in Europe, with hair-raising examples seen in Denmark (55.5%), France (55.2%), and Austria (55%). This rate, also called the ‘top statutory personal income tax rate’, applies to the share of income that falls into the highest tax bracket in progressive taxation (the first few dozens of thousands typically fall under various categories from 10% to 25%). In our calculation, we decided to use the effective tax figures (the average rate at which entire gross wages are taxed) to get the most accurate figure for each profession. In the following examples, the gross salaries are the median figures provided by job recruiting site Glassdoor. Project manager According to data collected by Euronews Business, the median project manager salary is the highest in Denmark (across all levels of experience and all industries), but when personal income tax and social security contributions are deducted (counting for a combined 35.5%), you may find that companies in Switzerland give an almost equally good offer. If you prefer strong workers' rights, a wide range of social security support and fine wine, France may be an altogether better destination. Mainly depending on your seniority and level of education, gross project manager salaries fall between €45,000 and €75,000 in the EU’s second-biggest economy, where the take-home pay of an average single worker, after tax and benefits, was 72.3% of their gross wage in 2022 (the OECD average was 75.4%). Data analyst Data analysis is in increasing demand in Europe. Despite Denmark offering the highest gross salary, Switzerland has the best offer, where workers take home 81.5% of their gross salary - the highest rate across the continent. Among the countries in the mid-range of gross salaries, Belgium is among the highest, offering a gross salary of €68,424. However, its net offer translates to something below €41,000, whereas in Estonia the same job could pay net €48,030. Well, if you're a data analyst, we can let you deal with the rest… Software developer Among the vacant positions advertised online in the second quarter of 2023, software developers and sales assistants were the most in demand in Europe. Taking into consideration net income, software developers earn the most in Switzerland (€89,998), Denmark (€78,516), Iceland (€62,536) and Estonia (€56,451). But if you take a closer look atwhere the highest amount of vacancies in Europe are waiting, the Netherlands and Belgium may be better options. Sales manager Sales managers offer considerable salaries in Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and Belgium, with the highest average net salary reaching €171,781 in Denmark - that's more than €14,000 a month. Engineer Engineers in Switzerland can expect an annual net salary of more than €89,000, the highest in Europe, whereas the average annual net salary for this profession across the continent is a little more than €39,500. According to the data selection, out of the five jobs and the numerous countries' offers we examined, the title of highest net average annual salary goes to sales managers in Denmark (€171,781), whereas the lowest is a modest €15,503 for engineers in Croatia. The cost of living and rates of inflation also need to be taken into account when working out what the net salary is actually worth in a specific country.

https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/11/22/france-worried-about-precious-camembert-cheese-packaging,"France worried about precious Camembert cheese packaging France is worried about its precious Camembert cheese as the EU says its wooden packaging is hard to recycle sustainably. The European Union has long known that the way to France’s heart is through its stomach. So, don’t touch the Camembert - never, ever. On Wednesday, legislators at the European Parliament are voting to make sure it doesn’t happen. In one of the many legal proposals on streamlining and optimising waste management throughout the 27-nation bloc, some French cheese producers sniffed out something and turned it into a culinary stink. They claimed that the proposal would make it illegal for Camembert to be cradled into its usual wooden packaging for its final weeks of ripening and, eventually, sale. The round box is as essentially Camembert as its unctuous texture and pungent smell. Suddenly, there was a frenzied flutter that something fundamentally French would fall foul of the Brussels bureaucrats - derisively known by many as Eurocrats - who are all too often blamed for flaws real and false. “It is a matter of common sense. Don’t touch our Camemberts!” said Jean-Paul Garraud, a member of the European Parliament for France’s far-right Rassemblement National. If forced into something easier to recycle like plastic, the perfect breathing of the cheese through wood might otherwise get sweaty and flabby. Wood, though, is very hard to recycle sustainably, so the EU plans to move it out of food packaging as much as possible. Even General Charles de Gaulle, the French World War II hero and later president of the nation, knew all about the cheese issue. “How do you want to run a country that has 246 kinds of cheese,” he was quoted as complaining. The centre-right European People’s Party, the biggest group in the European Parliament with a traditional farming electorate and penchant for heritage protection, came to the defence of the wooden boxes for Camembert and other cheeses. “Our French cheeses are loved all over the world. But who can imagine a Camembert or a Mont d’Or without its wooden strapping? Packaging them in plastic would be a gustatory and environmental aberration,” said French MEP Laurence Sailliet. “Europe must know how to protect the environment, but never to the detriment of the specific characteristics of its member states,” she added. And food is one of the touchiest characteristics, for sure. The British used anti-EU food foment to the extreme in the years leading up to Brexit, with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then still a Brussels journalist, leading the tabloid assault with stories that the EU would insist that bananas would have to be straight and eliminate beloved British biscuits. It helped turn the United Kingdom against the EU, and voters decided in a referendum to leave. France is very far from that stage, but Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius said on Tuesday the EU would make sure that the raw-milk specialized non-industrial Camemberts — those that have a controlled designation of origin — will be exempt from any regulation. The vote on Wednesday will include such an exemption. “Indeed, in the EU, certain food packaging made of wood, textiles, ceramics are placed on the market in very small quantities, and many of them protected by the food quality legislation,” Sinkevicius said. “Such packaging may have difficulties to be recycled at scale and is open for specific exemptions.” You might also like Grapes of wrath: Why French winemakers are protesting a new proposal US Thanksgiving traditions to make Europeans shudder Food of the future?

https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/10/31/eu-divisions-on-gaza-risk-weakening-it-on-the-foreign-policy-stage,"EU divisions on Gaza risk weakening it on the foreign policy stage The EU was late to clarify that Israel had an obligation to minimise casualties while the country was bombing and cutting off fuel, water and medical supplies to a civilian population. The EU's response to Hamas's horrific terrorist attack in Israel earlier this month cast a shadow on the bloc's ability to agree cohesive statement on deeply consequential foreign policy matters, despite having managed to stay aligned for nearly two years on Ukraine. At an EU summit last week, member states spent hours debating whether the bloc should call for a ceasefire to allow vital humanitarian aid into Gaza. In the end, they coalesced around the idea of ""humanitarian pauses"" - intermittent moments to allow unfettered access for goods to go into Gaza. They also reiterated that Israel has the right to defend itself, and should abide by international humanitarian law - the rules of conduct during an armed conflict that are designed to minimise casualties and not cause unnecessary suffering to civilians. But the statement to Israel to respect the rights of civilians came late, despite the besieged population in Gaza being cut off from food, water, fuel, and crucial medical supplies, and the ever-increasing death toll of women, children, men. The EU's partners in the region including King Abdullah of Jordan condemned the late and lackluster pronouncement to protect Palestinians. “The message the Arab world is hearing is loud and clear: Palestinian lives matter less than Israeli ones. Our lives matter less than other lives. The application of international law is optional. And human rights have boundaries - they stop at borders, they stop at races, and they stop at religions,"" King Abdullah said at a conference in Cairo on October 23. This is a “very, very dangerous message, as the consequences of continued international apathy and inaction will be catastrophic—on us all,"" he added. Yet the growing humanitarian disaster and the intensity of Israel's military campaign are unlikely to change the EU's position, according to Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group. ""I think Germany may even be more pro-Israeli in its stance and articulation of Israel's right to defend itself than the United States. And I don't think that position within Germany - which commands support across the coalition is likely to change in the short to medium term, regardless of how the ground invasion progresses in Gaza and the civilian casualties and the devastation we're all now likely to see,"" he told Euronews. As the war escalates so can divisions within the EU, which could further delegitimize the bloc as a foreign policy actor. It's ""clearly going to open up a rift within the European Council between those countries that have a slightly different position and perspective on the conflict."" ""And that, again, will subtract from European legitimacy"", especially as the divisions among member states ""are only going to get worse,"" Rahman also said. Last week, the EU committed to supporting - alongside regional partners - an International Peace Forum aimed at resuscitating long-lost hope of a two-state solution between Israel and Palestinians. Pierre Vimont, a former head of the EU's External Action Service - the EU's foreign office - also believes the impact of Brussels's ambivalence over the rights of Palestinians has diminished it in the eyes of other parts of the world. Still, he insists, the EU has a role to play. ""It has now to deal with a kind of handicap with regard to Arab countries and more globally, more generally, with many partners in the South that have lost somewhat their confidence in the European Union diplomacy. So we have to rebuild that. We have to reach out to all of them,"" he told Euronews. ""Never forget that it was the European Union that came up with the idea of a two-state solution, the need for self-determination for the Palestinians, the support for the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) as the representative of the Palestinian people."" ""These were breakthroughs that were done by the European Union and that were followed afterward by the US, who took over, who took up some of the European ideas,"" he said.

https://www.euronews.com/2023/10/31/new-slovak-pm-fico-deploys-police-and-armed-forces-to-hungary-border-to-block-migrants,"New Slovak PM Fico deploys police and armed forces to Hungary border to block migrants Prime Minister Robert Fico did not immediately provide further details but said illegal migration must be controlled or else people linked to “terrorist” groups could enter the country. The new Slovak government announced a deployment of police and armed forces on Monday along the border with Hungary to prevent growing numbers of migrants entering the country. Prime Minister Robert Fico did not immediately provide further details but said illegal migration must be controlled or else people linked to “terrorist” groups could enter the country. At a press conference near the Slovakian-Hungarian border, Fico said that 46,000 illegal migrants entered Slovakia in the first 10 months of 2023. ""They arrived freely, almost as if they were on a trip,"" he said. ""Nobody was prepared for them at the border. Nobody checked them. They crossed the border checkpoints, knocked on the door of the nearest police department where they were given some paperwork."" Fico, who spoke after meeting Interior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok, said the deployment would start immediately and that he would personally inspect the situation at the border. His new government was sworn in last Wednesday after his leftist Smer, or Direction, party won the September parliamentary election, opening the way for the populist leader to become prime minister for the fourth time. The new government has not yet released its policy program, but Fico has suggested it will include a tough stance against migration. Estok said that the situation in the world has been serious recently due to the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas, which attacked the country on 7 October, and that he expected a new wave of migration.

https://www.euronews.com/business/2023/11/30/making-money-on-defence-stocks-is-it-ethical-to-cash-in-on-the-boom,"Making money on defence stocks: Is it ethical to cash in on the boom? When the war in Ukraine began almost two years ago demand for weapons in Europe skyrocketed, taking arms companies’ shares along with it. Experts expect the market to continue to grow for at least the next five years. Here’s why. With the Ukraine-Russia war continuing and the Middle East conflict between Israel and Hamas intensifying, it doesn't look like the guns will be laid down any time soon. As a result, the defence market is booming across the world, and experts say it is here to stay. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global military expenditure increased by 3.7% in real terms last year, to reach a record high of $2.24 (€2.04) trillion. The US is undoubtedly the dominant force. Based on SIPRI’s latest data, the country accounted for half of the arms sales of the top 100 arms-producing and military services companies worldwide in 2021. Despite China and Russia being significant players, Europe comes in second place, responsible for at least 19.3% of arms sales in 2021. As reported by SIPRI, the top three European defence companies were BAE Systems (UK), Leonardo (Italy) and Airbus (trans-European). Looking at the stock market, we can see that these companies are thriving. In the past year, Leonardo’s share price almost doubled, while BAE’s increased by 38% and Airbus’, by 16%. The arms market will likely continue to grow “for the next five years at least,” Lucie Béraud-Sudreau, director of SIPRI’s military expenditure and arms production programme, told Euronews. How experts know the arms market won’t falter in coming years “Most European countries are increasing their military expenditure,” Béraud-Sudreau said. According to SIPRI, Europe was by farwhere military spending rose the most- by 13% - last year, largely due to Russian and Ukrainian spending. Meanwhile, NATO defence ministers have agreed to commit a minimum of 2% of GDP to defence spending to ensure the alliance's military readiness in case of a conflict. However, governments didn’t take the guideline seriously until the war in Ukraine broke out. Over the last 10 years, “nobody imagined there would be another traditional war,” Sejal Varshney, an analyst at European equity research firm AlphaValue, told Euronews. Military combat on the battlefield was thought to have been forever replaced by bloodless wars, such as economic warfare, and ideological and geopolitical struggles for global influence, she explained. Governments therefore were not investing in their defence capacity. For example, one year ago, German media reported that the country only hadammunition for one or two days of war, against the standard stock recommendation for 30 days of high-intensity combat. With the prediction of the end of conventional wars proven wrong, “European demand for artillery and ammunition now far exceeds the supply,” Varshney said. And experts expect it to keep rising. “Europe’s defence budgets will continue growing by over 10% per year, over the next five years”, Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote in an article. In addition, arms companies now have more negotiating power. Sending vast amounts of military equipment and ammunition to Ukraine has been putting a huge strain on European stockpiles. So governors have been asking manufacturers to speed up production. In exchange, governments either “co-invest or modify their payment policy, making intermediate payments instead of just a balloon payment after delivery"", AlphaValue’s equity analyst highlighted. Better pay terms improve the companies’ cash generation, which attracts investors. In response to rising demand, European defence companies are also expanding their production facilities and as a result, “benefitting from economies of scale,” according to Varshney. Investing in war or defence? When considering whether or not to invest in companies that produce weapons, you may face a major ethical question: Am I funding war and death? Experts diverge on the answer. On the one hand, some hold a firm position against investing in arms companies. “Financing arms manufacturing means financing warfare,” Johanna Schmidt, a sustainability researcher at Triodos Bank, said. Schmidt believes investing in weapons is highly related to “human rights violation” - as “the role of weapons is to kill or threaten people” - and does not “contribute to the sustainable development of societies and economies”. Alternatively, the sustainability researcher suggests you put your money into “great social impact”, which means investing in education, health care, sustainable infrastructure, among others. “These are good investments,” she said. On the other hand, Varshney said that betting on European arms companies means “investing in the defence sector, which the war has impacted.” Garnry agrees, always referring to the companies that produce weapons in Europe as ""European defencecompanies"". He also highlighted that “defence is becoming a long-term growth theme.” And even if the war in Ukraine were to end today, Varshney believes the markets' upward trajectory wouldn’t change since “the war chests are empty” and governments would still feel the “need to be prepared for worst-case scenarios.” You might also like Here's why global investors will be closely watching the OPEC+ meeting Europe 'aiding and assisting' Israel's war in Gaza Sanctions on Hamas’ investment unlikely to shake group's funding Most read Which European countries have the highest and lowest salaries?

https://www.euronews.com/2023/11/29/wife-of-ukraine-intelligence-chief-in-hospital-after-heavy-metal-poisoning,"Russia denies involvement in poisoning of Ukrainian intelligence chief's wife Marianna Budanova is now recovering in hospital, where blood tests have reportedly revealed heavy metal poisoning. The wife of Ukraine's intelligence chief is reportedly in hospital receiving treatment for heavy metal poisoning. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence (GUR) said on Tuesday that several people had been poisoned at its headquarters in Kyiv, including Marianna Budanova, the wife of Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the Ukrainian secret service. Kyiv has cast its suspicions on Russia, although the culprit has not yet been found and the investigation is still ongoing. Moscow, for its part, has denied any involvement in the poisoning. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the suspicions as ""routine accusations"". ""Ukraine blames Russia for everything. Ukraine even blames Russia for its very existence. These are routine accusations,"" the spokesman told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Interfax news agency. Monitoring Budanova's recovery After feeling unwell for ""a long time"", Budanova was admitted to hospital, where blood tests have revealed heavy metal poisoning in her system, Ukrainian officials say. Intelligence sources have told the Ukrainian media that “these substances are not used in any way, either in everyday life or in military matters. Their presence could indicate an attempt to poison a specific person”. Mild symptoms of poisoning were also observed in other agency workers, according to the same sources. Little is known about Budanova's health, with the GUR saying only that her medical treatment has been completed, but that she is still in hospital and they are waiting to see how she progresses. ""The treatment is completed and then there will be a check-up by the doctors,” they told Ukrainian media. Both Budanov and Budanova live in Kyiv's intelligence headquarters, and initial indications from the investigation suggest that the poisoning may have been caused by food. The Ukrainian newspaper Babel, which first reported the news, noted that Budanov had been the victim of possible poisoning both before and during the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian defence ministry has launched an investigation into what's behind the poisoning. It has not yet been confirmed whether the ultimate target was Budanova herself or her husband. Budanova does not work in the country's state administration, since June 2021 she has been working as an adviser to Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko. While her husband holds one of the most important posts in the country, working hand in hand with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnkyy. Budanov has played a key role in overseeing and executing major military operations against Russian forces following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. He was also the main mastermind of Ukrainian sabotage operations on Russian territory and in the Crimean peninsula.

https://www.euronews.com/2023/11/28/polish-truckers-blockade-continues-along-border-with-ukraine,"Polish truckers blockade continues along border with Ukraine The EU scrapped entry permit requirements for Ukraine to support its war effort against Russia.  Polish truck drivers now want these requirements  to be reinstated. Polish truck drivers and farmers extended the blockade to the Medyka border crossing last week, one of the busiest crossings with Ukraine. Four border crossings are now blocked in total, in the protest thatbegan on November 6. Polish truck drivers say they are unfairly disadvantaged since their Ukrainian counterparts do not have to pay for permits to enter the EU. They want the requirements to be reinstated. 2,700 trucks stuck at the border The queues are growing, and so is the discontent among Ukrainian truckers. ""The procedure that used to take 10 to 15 hours now takes a week,"" said Igor, a Ukrainian truck driver stuck at the border. ""So it's not easy. The conditions are inhuman."" Ukrainian media reported that two Ukrainian drivers, aged 54 and 56, died of natural causes while in the queue at the border. The same sources said essential goods, such as humanitarian aid are being delayed, in spite of earlier promises by Polish truckers that the blockade would apply only to non-essential goods. Ukrainian officials and industry representatives said the demands are unrealistic, with some even pointing to strong pro-Russian sentiment among Polish protesters.

https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/11/29/dutch-version-of-controversial-royal-book-pulled-over-race-row-error,"Dutch version of controversial royal book pulled over race row 'error' Names have been named in the Dutch version of Omid Scobie's controversial royal book - something which the original English version did not. The Dutch edition of Omid Scobie'scontroversial book""Endgame: Inside the Royal Family and the Monarchy’s Fight for Survival"" has been withdrawn from sale, with its publishers blaming a translation error. The publishers Xander Uitgevers said it was ""temporarily withdrawing the book"", entitled ""Eindstrijd"" in the Dutch version. ""An error occurred in the Dutch translation and is currently being rectified,"" the publishers added. The ""error"" seems to be the description of the racism row that followed Prince Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey, where the couple talked of facing questions about the skin colour of their baby. The claim was met by a rare response from the royals, with Prince William saying: ""We are very much not a racist family."" ""Eindstrijd"" appeared to include the name of a Royal Family member alleged to have asked skin colour questions, whereas in the English edition of the book, Scobie claimed that there had been two people involved but said that for legal reasons he wouldn't disclose their names. ""The book is in several languages, and unfortunately I do not speak Dutch. But if there are translation errors, the publisher will correct them,"" he told RTL Boulevard. ""I wrote the English version. There was no version from me in which names were mentioned."" The book, published yesterday, has been very critical of the Royal Family. ""Endgame"" criticises King Charles III and his son, William, who is described as a ""power-hungry heir to the throne"", and depicts the king as head of an institution ""plagued by incidents involving antiquated ideas around race, class and money"", with younger people increasingly unsympathetic to the monarchy. The main revelations depict a rather pathetic soap opera, in which, amongst other things, William is painted as an ambitious prince, determined to lead the royal family into the future, with Scobie claiming that he wants to “rip up” the rulebook and do things “the Cambridge way”.

https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/11/22/meet-the-first-spanish-ai-model-earning-up-to-10000-per-month,"Meet the first Spanish AI model earning up to €10,000 per month Aitana, an exuberant 25-year-old pink-haired woman from Barcelona, receives weekly private messages from celebrities asking her out. But this model is not real, she was created by her designers using AI. Aitana, the first Spanish model created by artificial intelligence, was born in the middle of a difficult period. Last summer, Rubén Cruz, her designer and founder of the agency The Clueless, was going through a rough patch because he didn't have many clients. ""We started analysing how we were working and realised that many projects were being put on hold or cancelled due to problems beyond our control. Often it was the fault of the influencer or model and not due to design issues,"" Cruz told Euronews. So they decided to create their own influencer to use as a model for the brands that approached them. They created Aitana, an exuberant 25-year-old pink-haired woman from Barcelona whose physical appearance is close to perfection. The virtual model can earn up to € 10,000 a month, according to her creator, but the average is around € 3,000. ""We did it so that we could make a better living and not be dependent on other people who have egos, who have manias, or who just want to make a lot of money by posing,"" says Cruz. Aitana's income is quite scattered. She earns just over € 1,000 per advert, and has recently become the face of Big, a sports supplement company, and as if that weren't enough, she uploads photos of herself in lingerie to Fanvue, a platform similar to OnlyFans. In just a few months, she has managed to gain more than 121,000 followers on Instagram and her photos get thousands of views and reactions. She even receives private messages from celebrities who are unaware that she is not an actual person. ""One day, a well-known Latin American actor texted to ask her out. This actor has about 5 million followers and some of our team watched his TV series when they were kids,"" says Cruz. ""He had no idea Aitana didn't exist,"" he adds. How do you bring an AI to life? Every week the agency team has a meeting to create Aitana's life. They decide what she will do during the week, which places she will visit and which photos will be uploaded to feed the followers who want to know about her. But there are no photo shoots, no wardrobe changes, just a mix of artificial intelligence and design experts who use Photoshop to make it possible for the model to spend the weekend in Madrid, for example. ""In the first month, we realised that people follow lives, not images. Since she is not alive, we had to give her a bit of reality so that people could relate to her in some way. We had to tell a story,"" says the graphic designer. That's why Aitana, unlike traditional models whose personalities are usually not revealed so that they can be a 'blank canvas' for designers, has a very distinct 'personality'. She was created as a fitness enthusiast, determined and with a complex character. On her website she defines herself as outgoing and caring. ""A lot of thought has gone into Aitana. We created her based on what society likes most. We thought about the tastes, hobbies and niches that have been trending in recent years,"" explains Cruz. After analysing trends, they realised that oriental culture had become very Europeanised in recent years, so they tried to capture this in her pink hair and gamer side. Aitana has been such a success that her designers have already created a second virtual model called Maia, ""a little more shy"". The names were not chosen at random either, both contain the acronym for artificial intelligence (AI). Democratising the use of models? The agency has been inundated with requests from brands wanting their own personalised model. ""They want to have an image that is not a real person and that represents their brand values, so that there are no continuity problems if they have to fire someone or can no longer count on them,"" says Cruz. There are also cost savings. When the agency, which used to work with real influencers, realised what they were earning, they found it ""anomalous"". ""Kim Kardashian makes a million euros for an Instagram photo and she doesn't cure cancer. Nobody earns a million euros for uploading a photo to a social network, it seems absurd to me,"" he says. The agency believes this could help bring down market prices and give a boost to small companies that cannot afford big advertising campaigns. However, the initiative is not without its critics. Many are concerned that the unrealistic perfection of the models could influence the younger generation to become obsessed with achieving such perfection. There is also criticism of the highly sexualised image of the models created. To which the agency responds that they are simply following the aesthetic already created by the real influencers and brands themselves. ""If we don't follow this aesthetic, brands won't be interested. To change this system, you have to change the vision of the brands. The world in general is sexualised.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/30/spain-pm-pedro-sanchez-israel-hamas-terror-attacks-gaza,"Spanish prime minister says he doubts Israel is respecting international law Pedro Sánchez condemns Hamas terror attacks but urges Israel to rethink operations in Gaza The Israeli government has recalled its ambassador in Madrid and said it will be reprimanding Spain’s top diplomat in Tel Aviv after the Spanish prime minister,Pedro Sánchez, said he had “genuine doubts” about whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law in its offensive in Gaza. Sánchez’s latest remarks came a week afterhe caused a diplomatic spatby usinga visit to Israelto urge it to rethink its operations in Gaza, claiming its response to Hamas’s atrocitieson 7 October could not “imply the deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children”. Speaking to Spain’s state broadcaster, TVE, on Thursday morning, Sánchez repeated his condemnation of Hamas’s attacks but said “friendly countries really have to be able to tell each other things”. “We’ve said from the very beginning that what Hamas did in Israel is absolutely atrocious and abominable,”he said, adding that he had watched 20 minutes of “very tough” footageof the attacks during last week’s meeting with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. “We’ve also always shown our public commitment to Hamas having to free all the hostages they hold immediately and without any conditions whatsoever,” Sánchez said. “But we have to tellIsrael, with the same conviction, that its actions must be based on international humanitarian law. But with the images we’re seeing and the growing number of people – especially boys and girls – who are being killed, I have genuine doubts that they’re complying with international humanitarian law.” The Spanish leader said a political solution to the crisis required “the recognition of the Palestinian state”, adding: “It’s in Europe’s interest to address this issue out of moral conviction because what we are seeing in Gaza is not acceptable.” Spain has already indicated it could be willing to unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state if other EU members fail to do so collectively. His words met with a furious response from the Israeli government. Netanyahu said he had instructed his foreign minister, Eli Cohen, to call in Spain’s ambassador for a reprimand “after the shameful statement by the Spanish prime minister”. He also noted that the comments had come on a day whenHamas gunmen murdered three people and injured 13 others in East Jerusalem. Cohen said Sánchez’s “outrageous words” had prompted him to call the Israeli ambassador in Madrid to return for consultations. He added: “Israel acts and will continue to act according to international law and we will continue the war until the release of all the abductees and the elimination of Hamas inGaza.” During last week’s joint visit to the region with Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, Sánchez said the number of dead Palestinians was “truly unbearable” and reiterated that the creation of a Palestinian state remained the best way to bring peace and security to the region. De Croo said Israel’s military operation needed to respect international humanitarian law, adding: “The killing of civilians needs to stop.” The pair’s comments led the Israeli foreign ministry to accuse them of “giving support to terrorism” and to summon the ambassadors of both countries. Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, called the Israeli government’s comments “false, misplaced and unacceptable”.

Israel’s embassy in Madrid described the remarks as “deeply immoral” and accused some Spanish MPs of aligning themselves with “Isis-style terrorism”. Spain responded with its own strongly worded statement that accused the Israeli embassy of “spreading falsehoods” about some cabinet members. “In a full democracy, such as Spain, any political leader can freely express their positions as the representative of a political party,” the statement from the foreign ministry said. “In any case, the Spanish government’s position on the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas is clear: unequivocal condemnation; demands for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages, and the recognition of Israel to defend itself within the limits set by international law and international humanitarian law.” At least 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage when Hamas fighters crossed the border from Gaza on 7 October, according to Israeli figures. According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, about 15,000 people, 40% of them children, have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory strikes.
